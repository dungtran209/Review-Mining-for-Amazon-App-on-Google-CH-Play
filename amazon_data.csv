Alice,07/03/2019,2,"I really wish they would bring back the recommendations tab in the menu, that was on older versions. It was so easy to find recs for kindle books or any other department based on what your interests had shown. Just can't find an easy way of doing it on the newer versions so I guess i'll go back and install an old version again. What do you think Amazon?"
Kirk Davis,07/03/2019,1,"Treasure truck keeps crashing sigh. Update: still crashing every time I try to select a pick up location for the treasure truck; very bad. (Just to be clear, Amazon itself is fabulous: but this app needs FIXING.) Update: Still crashing after today's update."
A Google user,07/03/2019,1,Browsing history keeps recording even when the setting is turned off. Toggling that switch through the app or through the desktop does nothing. The setting is either broken or ignored by amazon.....
stephen chiusano,07/03/2019,2,"The latest version is much improved, but it still wants to load the ""ads"" before the main content of the page, such as the status if orders"
Ben Kosto,07/03/2019,5,"Works nicely.... I would like it if the settings were easier to navigate, maybe by adding a search bar just for finding certain account settings & options. It can be hard to find a specific setting sometimes. Other than that it's great!"
Douglas Sines,07/03/2019,3,I'm tired of this app being a glorified wrapper of the mobile website. There's a lot you can miss using this app versus the mobile and desktop experiences that it's insane this still exists in some form.

My My Walker,21/02/2019,5,I adore this app and all the support behind it. Never had a problem with it or anyone involved and if there was it was quickly resolved with a quick phone call to the wonderful staff at Amazon. Definately recommend looking into Prime membership if you are new it puts an end to many issues super fast plus you get next day shipping in most cases. Hint on services? you can get a huge discount on Prime membership as well. A quick photo copy of a food stamps card and membership is deeply discounted.
James Quinn Visuals,27/02/2019,2,"Convenient & reliable about 40% of the time. I've lost soo much money by making business related purchases for clients. I'd pay extra for faster shipping fost my important purchases & they almost ALWAYS are late. My business has suffered. I'd honestly rather paying more & be assured that I'm getting my lenses, camera bodies, computers, vinyl, paint, etc etc ON TIME. I got a free year of prime. and I give you my word that I will never patronize this organization again."
Jamise Brown,03/03/2019,2,"Friday, I ordered my girlfriend a dildo for her bridal party on Sunday. I paid $3.99 for expedited shipping ( but was offered free shipping if I used a Monday delivery date) to get it delivered on Sunday between 7:30am-1pm. The party is @ 3:30pm. 7:30am Today(Sunday) I recieved an email from Amazon stating my package delivery date is now Monday in which I could have gotten that time for free. Be careful of Amazon's new tricks. Dont depend on them to give you accurate shipping info. SMDH..."
Tonja Amen Ra,21/02/2019,3,"Average some things do not arrive on the date of which Amazon denotes. In my humble opinion, Nothing Should be Not Apart of the items . I was ' told ' that it Would be sent on Tuesday. So I call / text today [ thru text msg] I today was told , that the foundation brush would have arrived with the other items. Thus Far on (Wednesday) the brush was Not Apart of the other items. I look forward too your response. As well ... how does this work , if I DO NOT receive the foundation brush?"
Alex Miller,23/02/2019,1,"huge fan of Amazon and this service(not a huge fan of what they have done to my home town of Issaquah, WA with them making it impossible to live here with increasing the cost of living to make me move) but I'm very upset with them making me switch apps. the previous app was way more smooth, easy to use and looked nicer, it seems like I'm taking a huge step back with this new app. I'll be looking elsewhere until the user experience is improved."
Keith C.,28/02/2019,1,The geniuses at Amazon now require you to have 3 levels of authentication to simply log into you account. How freaking stupid is this. if someone can get past my password plus a second level of authentication they deserve access to my account but forcing me to have so many multiple layers of authentication is tedious and extremely annoying. Using the app as a seller is an absolute don't.
Victoria Gross,23/02/2019,5,it's a cool app. I can usually find all I need on here. prime is the best thing to have. I dont have it but my bf do and it comes in handy! I've never really had a problem with the items before. but one time my guy did and they was super helpful and explained everything clearly.
Its Omar,28/02/2019,1,"it would be good if not orders that shows 2 stops away delivered 4 h later, or showing on the way and then magically changing to "" expected delivery"" in sometimes 6 weeks! but my winner - shows 8 stops away, then cancelled, then waiting to be in stock just to magically disappear in my orders list ( after 3 months ) without money being returned, so be aware ."
Travis Tabor,24/02/2019,3,"I am a big Amazon shopper. Your search algorithms leave me frustrated more often than not. No matter how specific I get when searching accessories for my phone, I ALWAYS wind up with items not relevant to my phone. I have once purchased an item that was not for my phone (my fault), but your algorithm did not help."
Tillie Wolf,24/02/2019,5,"I really like how fast and secure my account is. I can look at different price options for a product without being forced to purchase one particular vendor. The fact that I can track my products from the time its pulled off the shelves and on route to me, is also an added plus."
Jason Treichler,06/03/2019,2,"The WORST customer service most of the time. Occasionally, u get someone who helps but if u get Reanna or Meenu, dont even try. Sarcastic, rude and completely unhelpful. And the sadest part of all, Reanna is the supervisor and was by far the most disrespectful customer service rep I've ever had to deal with. She shouldn't even be allowed to work at McDonald's."
amil khaya mfo,28/02/2019,1,it works for some people but in my case no one helped me when i called several times for them to allow me to purchase something as they blocked my account for no reason asking me for my billing adress when i did what they asked no one helped me. so im sure many others go thru what im going thru. so im unsatisfied with the service to help customers when they need help
Jane Doe,03/03/2019,3,Amazon always had a thing saying if I used this app that I would receive a $5 credit. So I used it for a while and never received the $5 credit. I preferred to use the other app because it ran smoother and had a cleaner look. Now I am being forced to use the inferior version. Way to force a downgrade amazon!
rene ferro,04/03/2019,1,every time I try to order something it just gives me a hassle. I am 60 years old and you know what some people need guidance. I hate this completely pain in the ass with the password all. Here's an idea provide a number where you can help people who could not care less at being tech savvy but just want to buy things
Mitchell Brown,06/03/2019,2,"The app is very slow. The app stutters a lot. The app is getting overrun by ads and ""sponsored"" items. Even though a product matches my search criteria exactly, you will be shown irrelevant items before you see what you've searched for. They need to make it easier to clear all searched history - without going through settings and different screens, or deleting one at a time."
KNoX,24/02/2019,5,"If you like shopping on Amazon then you'll love this! It's just like shopping on Amazon but instead of finding that pesky ""new tab"" button within your internet browser then painstakingly pushing it and, OOPS! you kinda moved your finger a little, try again! okay now you have to type ""amazonDOTcom"" then wait and finally, ahh üòñüí©ü§≠üëçüèº ¬°NOT NO MORE! finally you can just lightly blowüó£üí® on this beautifully crafted icon üíù and POOF! like wakasaki magik you're whisked away to the magical land of ü§ë"
Ashley Garcia,03/03/2019,1,"This app needs a major update! a lot of information i input gets lost and it looks like ebay on desktop in 2008. would love a dark mode as well? will change review when the new update comes out. come on man, you got *billions* of dollars. make that change!"
Charles R Harris Jr,24/02/2019,2,You have be careful dealing with Amazon especially if you pay for Amazon Prime. Late deliveries often. Promotional credits due with each Prime late delivery. Promotional credits do not appear on account. You must ask agent for amount of any Promotional credits issued to your account. Theses credits can only be applied to items SOLD SHIPPED BY AMAZON. You can find many of these if you limit search to AMAZON BASISC products. #BEWARE AMAZON WILL ACTIVATE PRIME ACCOUNT WITHOUT AUTHORZATION
David Hu,24/02/2019,3,"Functional but needs polish. Almost all essential functions are packed in the app. but the overall polish is just not there. The drawer menu is not adhesive to the left edge, the app icon is not adaptive (still legacy), app is a mix of native and web interface (which failed multiple time during my usage), the app functions are categorize in a weird way. This app is working, but that's about it. Could be better Amazon, considering you are not a small company anymore."
Hidden,20/02/2019,4,"Another update 20th February and still no biometric security for account management, come on Amazon it is time to do this, and it's not rocket science. No, 5 star rating till then. You are one of the worlds largest companies and your security updates are last century.... ü§î"
K Mcc,01/03/2019,1,"amazon is rapidly declining... terrible filter settings cause several items that aren't what you're looking for to show.... prime isn't prime anymore; two day shipping has turned into, more times than not, 4 or 5 day shipping. very disappointing."
Arnold Jereda,04/03/2019,5,"Just had a very bad experience with Best Buy on some speakers but thanks to Amason they saved my day. I've been a long time Customer through my wife's acct.. Best Buy promised me the moon, but came very short on the order, sorry Best Buy you lost a customer after I grave you my story to support outside business,and by the way your customer service blew it......thank you Amason once again you proved your worth."
Adair Gearhart,24/02/2019,1,"Like a lot of people, I order a ton of stuff from Amazon and have been a customer for years. I've never had any issues with it until I got this new app. It crashes, freezes, and generally glitches out almost every time I try to look for something or add to my cart. I've tried uninstall/reinstall, clearing caches, system updates, soft resets, you name it with no luck. This app is garbage."
brian spangler,28/02/2019,1,"The damn popup keep showing up when I look at my orders. All want to see is my orders! So this morning they closed or disactived the old app, nice move how many customers will you loose? Still sucks!"
Jaren3311,05/03/2019,4,"The latest update has made the app more responsive. They also fixed the two issues I mentioned previously: the ... button next to items on lists not working properly and adding items to lists from product pages. The only remaining problem is the bandwidth requirement; I doubt that will be addressed. Overall, I am very impressed with the recent update. Phone: OnePlus 2."
Beverly Stanback,19/02/2019,5,I've had nothing but positive experiences with Amazon from sign-in to receipt of my items. I subscribe to Amazon Prime and have Unlimited Kindle and take advantage of all they have to offer. I love that they are always working to be better. The update for Today's Bargains looks great!
freesh avocedoo,02/03/2019,1,Amazon is honestly terrible.. prime membership is a waste of money you're always getting ripped off. why cant we filter by things that only deliver to us instead of having to look through 3990 items that dont to find one that does?? Amazon really really really needs to step up honestly the only good thing about Amazon is the shipping times. other than that I would suggest shopping elsewhere cause they clearly are just money hungry and dont listen to their consumers.
A Google user,02/03/2019,1,latest upgrade deleted the ability to forward a product to a user not using the app from inside the app. Like through text message. why limit a customer's ability to buy products makes no sense. I'm going to have to delete this app so I can use a web browser. That's too bad
Austin,25/02/2019,2,"I'm on a Galaxy S7 and the app is terrible. it's incredibly slow and often unresponsive to touch, especially when adding items to a list. I often find myself hitting a button 20 times just to get something to happen. It's very frustrating and from what I've read it seems to be a popular issue. Not sure why one of the richest corporations in the world can't fix such simple problems."
A Google user,03/03/2019,2,"Yes it is possible to make purchases on this app. However, it is near impossible to navigate because of the intense lag. It goes so slow, and is so buggy that often times you have to close the app and open it again to get the buttons to work. I highly advise you to just order off of the desktop website. Needs a LOT of work."
Eric Stone,06/03/2019,1,"I absolutely HATE this app!! Crashes constantly. Used to work fine. They decided to add a bunch of animations and dog pictures, now it's all I ever see. I've updated it several times and it just seems to keep getting worse. I'll just use Amazon less. Shame."
A Google user,02/03/2019,5,I love Prime! It is worth every penny and has more than paid for itself. I have yet to b disappointed in my shopping or returns. We just spent a couple hours at the mall to buy Jean's for my husband. Couldn't find his size. Came home found them on Amazon and he even had a choice of colors.
Cesar Vazquez,27/02/2019,1,"Shipping is terrible. 1 day, 2 day, same day free or not, don't offer it if you can't deliver. I'm beginning to wonder why i shop here. you can get the same stuff from Walmart or Meijer online without the membership. And their delivery is on point."
Kathleen Culbertson,24/02/2019,1,"I've always preferred my desktop when shopping on Amazon, but the app came in very handy sometimes. Whatever they did has rendered it useless. I don't want Alexa in my face and I don't need a camera to search for things. I'm uninstalling."
Beth Richard,24/02/2019,2,"testy and challenging to use. add item to cart button stopped working, too... so now useless app. guess it's the proverbial straw to get me to stop using Amazon completely"
Brian Pivik,02/03/2019,3,"A bit laggy. I have prime and a few lists, but I don't see why it's so slow sometimes. Adding an item to my cart takes two presses and sometimes still doesn't ""take."""
Ashley Harn,05/03/2019,1,"The new update is extremely frustrating. The search algorithm is ridiculous. The previous version was a lot better. I could search for a product, and get really great results. Now? It seems like I get the same few search results. The way they changed the whole search experience just frustrates me. This is just about the app, I won't rate Amazon on the way they handle customers or orders, because this is just a review for the app."
A Google user,07/03/2019,3,The app itself if usually fine. I've had a couple issues with it freezing. I've had most issues with products that use UPS for shipping. Avoid them. UPS won't deliver your package on time and say they missed you even if you spent the entire day home waiting. Nightmare! I won't be buying products with that carrier again.
Kylie Sabra,04/03/2019,1,I'm not sure why we had to get rid of the old at. I never had a moment's trouble with it. Now I have nothing but trouble. The new app locks up constantly. I have to stop it restarted stop at restart it... Please fix it.
Michael Stone,23/02/2019,2,"For me this App. is brilliant. Works most of the time. Although recently i've noticed it's getting to be quite slow but at least it works! Update 23/2/19 Since the update it has got much worse. Yes i can still order goods but the wish list doesn't work properly, going back to the previous screen is difficult, it's become so slow that i'm waiting quite a while for it to open and other issues. Hope it gets sorted as this is the only app. i use to buy things."
John Chase,24/02/2019,3,I reinstalled this app hoping it would now work. I'm not sure if it is the poor quality of Hughesnet or if your server is overloaded but the buffering icon is too familiar. At one time the transmission was fast. No longer.
Keith Stackhouse,23/02/2019,2,"enngh, crappy. all that is provided is a shipping service. If you don't pay for prime they delay. For a week. You know what, I'd rather just buy from the manufacturer. Or a company that does not push a service. Wall Mart and home Depot aren't doing that with free shipping."
Cora Soleil,02/03/2019,1,My family is very upset by the recent decision to remove vaccine related documentaries from Amazon Prime! This is an issue of censorship which has NO PLACE in a free country! We are American citizens and we do not appreciate being manipulated like this. The truth cannot be censored! Information created by free citizens should be available to everyone. It is not Amazon's job to decide what information people should or should not see and believe.
Kharryn Albert,01/03/2019,2,I love this company but i hate that they always deliver my stuff to the neighbours. Its really a block of time cause I never know what time the next neighbours are going to get home. This company absolutely needs to stop this bs. Im getting frustrated now.
Yashica Jang,07/03/2019,1,I dont think Amazon is relevant anymore. It did not ship my orders because it needed me to send in my billing address and card number. I did and its still not shipping my order. I hope someone makes a new online shopping website. amazon AMAZON IN NOT THE BEST AT ALL.
padraic maughan,26/02/2019,1,"used to love this app but after a recent purchase, it's been a shambles of a service. During that purchase-at checkout, I was informed that delivery would be 1-2 days. After patiently waiting for 2 weeks, I contacted the seller 3 times only to be told each time to wait. I then contacted amazon support who kept ending the online chat conversation and were not interested in helping me at all. Amazon have changed for the worse unfortunately, won't be using them again."
deluzionalme,03/03/2019,3,"Every order I have placed or tried to place since Nov 2018 has had a problem. Amazon problems, not 3rd party issues. Never have I been so frustrated and angry with a company, when making a purchase. I used to consider Amazon a good, reliable and helpful source. I don't anymore. ü§® üò†"
Erica Sentire,03/03/2019,1,can i buy somthing with out singing in pleas. i can sing in i know my pass word you got to much security. havent been able to buy any thing 6 mouths . i will go to ebay if i have to. pass word is enough. cant sing in. i got help and its did not help.
Juliana Stockton,03/03/2019,4,"Is the intresting finds being updated correctly? When I open it, it still has things from over a month ago listed, and it says ""updated daily"" right at the top.Is there a problem on my end,or with the app? (I've tried updating the app itself,nothing changes)"
Karin Wilcox,27/02/2019,3,the new app update has made this app conpletely useless on my home wifi. its the only app that has done this and ive had a tech here to check my service. afger the most recent update it will no longer work on my home wifi at all. but works fine on verizone lte.
Christopher Digby,23/02/2019,1,Who in the #### created the wishlist tab at the bottom? Where do they reside? It has ruined my shopping experience on the app. I cant scroll without it taking over conpletely! As if im holding every single item when I just want to scroll down!
A Google user,06/03/2019,5,"Why is two day shipping 3-5 days now? and why does it cost extra to buy a prime item, if you're already paying prime membership? Amazon, you are ripping people off. we're canceling our membership"
Daelynn Belden,05/03/2019,4,"Overall, this is a fairly good app. I rarely have trouble with it, and Amazon's customer service associates, who can indeed be contacted via the app, are very helpful. My biggest gripe is that I wish you could set a custom price range when you are searching on the app, like you can on the website."
Catherine Edwards,23/02/2019,1,"UH-OH. Something went wrong... Amazon, what is up with the constant oh something went wrong messages on this new version of your app? It is darn near impossible to find or view products with the version I just downloaded this morning. I thought it was something wrong with my phone, but no - this morning's download is just as bad as the one I downloaded last week!"
Amitabh Suman,27/02/2019,1,"Amazon India is the waste. I order my products and trying to contact the customer care, no response. Only few option to choose from. No direct resolution. Amazon you are escaping from your responsibility. Poor service. No more Amazon."
Harry Myer,27/02/2019,5,"always works, love the lists, Prime two day shipping essential, return policy makes for a happy experience. loads fast, page is usually easy to navigate. love the prpduct compairsons, when all the info is there. Need to use larger type font and never use gray for font, cant read it. I never buy online of anyone else, just not safe nor as easy."
Love Child,01/03/2019,1,"Only works for me 50% of the time. Freezes often. Its hard to shop and enjoy this app, it becomes very stressful. This is the only app I have issues with. Refreshing and updates dont help! I almost hate it. Happens more when Im on wifi."
Christopher Bennett,20/02/2019,3,"Great app that I use almost every day, would be better if there was an option to use Amazon Smile. annoying to add things to my basket then faf around with the browser to Smile checkout."
Laura Brown,03/03/2019,2,my first time ever ordering from Amazon. I needed my washer part today and paid extra to have it by today 3/2/19 and it didnt show up. now they are saying it might be sunday thru Tuesday?!? I ordered I think 5 items. but it took 3 different shipments.I got amazon prime to be able to receive sooner! I'm so dissatisfied and disappointed!!! I definitely will cancel my subscription & wont order from them again! my step dad orders from them & has had problems lately
Jeremy Sumrall,02/03/2019,1,"This app has taken a nose dive. I'm a long time Amazon user, and lately, starting up the app and clicking the SEARCH FUNCTION causes it to crash IMMEDIATELY. I can view my old orders just fine, but anytime I try to use the SEARCH FUNCTION causes the app to crash WITHOUT FAIL. You can imagine how frustrating that can be. FIX THIS."
jd smith,07/03/2019,2,"Decent app, if you don't mind getting scammed whenever the free Prime is up. They don't notify you whenever you're Prime is about to be up, even if you select the option. Just another way for them to make money off of unsuspecting people who don't pay close attention."
A Google user,23/02/2019,3,"Good but flawed. Search option is useless and the filters are terrible. Also, Amazon knows that I'm in Ireland and insists on returning options that don't deliver to Ireland. This is so annoying because you think you've found something only to be told in bold red letters that they won't deliver to Ireland."
Matthew Eskuchen,06/03/2019,2,"Can't say how often I open Amazon through a notification, try to switch apps to research the item and then try to switch back to Amazon only to find it's not open in the background. Was just going to submit a question about an item, but jumped to chrome to check facts and couldn't get back to Amazon app to submit my question. ugh... now i have to go find the item and type question again. Also, I'm certain I've reviewed some items via the app in the past that no longer have my reviews."
T Sherwood,28/02/2019,2,"I am a long-time Amazon customer, but I must call out Amazon's awful Android app. There simply is no excuse for its bugginess and uselessness in certain product searches. I will focus on two problems: 1) Product searches. For example: How is it I can search for a book titled simply ""Macklin"" and said book, which IS sold by Amazon, comes up nowhere on the first few pages of results? Try it and see. 2) The ""Content and Devices"" page IS UTTERLY useless. Try it yourself. It simply hangs, full stop."
Tim Emmitt,01/03/2019,3,"Amazon censors negative reviews about its own products. I tried to post a review about the Amazon Fire Stick, stating only plain facts, with no obscenities, and they rejected it because they claimed it was about the ""seller"" not the ""product""."
Sylvain Lecours,26/02/2019,3,"there is a bug that makes the app hard to use, whenever we have to chose color or size for an item, when tapping the done word just above, nothing happens. the color/size selectopn stays on screen and am stuck there. have to go on web version instead to be able to complete my selection"
Pegg Bauer,02/03/2019,1,"Amazon has given into political pressure (likely with a handsome cash payout) to censor products that refute the Big Pharma's unsupported position that all vaccines are ""safe and effective."" This is the electronic version of book burning. What right does Amazon have to censor my reading/viewing material as long as it is not illegal? Disappointed (understatement) in Amazon, and am rethinking my reliance on it."
Nicole Mitchell,03/03/2019,1,"I used to love my membership and recommended amazon prime to everyone. I loved my 2 day shipping that made mom so much easier, but in recent days you have decided to control what others are able to buy and watch and have taken away our right to freedom of speech. What you have done is unAmerican and goes against everything our founding fathers and our soldiers have faught for. I cannot stand by a company that believes in censorship, so I'll be supporting those who believe in our rights."
Bonny Kadimo,24/02/2019,3,Quite dissatisfied with the lack of choice for my region. Can't fault the app though. It works as it should. Just wish Amazon could expand its global store.
D H,23/02/2019,1,"It keeps showing me prices for the items I search, and but after I click the item, the price jumps up by several dollars. Stop the bait and switch and dishonesty, because all it's going to do is cost you a Prime member. I also can't stand the unwanted notifications for suggestions on stuff I don't use. I might search for stuff for orhers for their birthdays, but it doesn't mean I want a dozen suggestions for it either."
Shalee Michelle,21/02/2019,3,"My ""interesting likes"" aren't refreshing at their usual rate, despite all of my efforts to heart/like different things in an attempt to jog the algorithim. It's been showing me the exact same suggestions for at LEAST 2wks now, so needless to say, I'd definitely appreciate a fix for this issue. I'd happily adjust my rating to 5 if it's fixed. Thanks. UPDATE I wrote this review on February 9th and there's still been no improvement. It's still showing the same suggestions after roughly 4+wks. FIX."
Alec McLaughlin,24/02/2019,1,Very glitchy on note 9. It wont let me add things to my cart frequently and certain buttons/links are unclickable.
Shiyanbola Idris,02/03/2019,1,My order was cancelled and my gift card balance was deducted after making an order. I tried reaching the customers care service but no response. Too bad for Amazon!!!
Benjamin Aguilar,23/02/2019,5,"So far I've been completely satisfied with Amazon, any items I was dissatisfied with I was able to return them and get my refund. And everything I've kept I'm happy with. I'm always looking here for more good deals. Keep it up Amazon, I've been recommending you to all of my friends. ( both of them (j/k))"
ImDaJuggernaut AkaJuggs,02/03/2019,5,"Love the simplicity of having everything at my fingertips through the app. No more going on the computer to try to find stuff, and I love the instant notifications through the app when my items are bought and shipped. Thanks!"
A Google user,20/02/2019,1,I find this app very difficult to use and the items and departments almost impossible. The previous version had it's limitations but was far better than this latest one. in
Mikki Evans,05/03/2019,2,Very laggy and buggy. To search more than 1 item I have to close out of the app completely and reload it every single time.
Tish Roberts Guel,22/02/2019,2,"App worked beautifully until 2 weeks ago. Now, when I try to check out it gives me password incorrect errors where the browser works just fine with the same login. I need both to function as I use my family account in one and my private personal account in the other. Rather than constantly switch login info, I have just started using outside retailers when I need something and will continue to do so until this issue is resolved. *Note: Uninstall/reinstall and PW reset did not work ."
Kristen Rudd,06/03/2019,5,"I shop almost everyday, and I don't have any regrets!!!! Our county has one Walmart. We have few over priced local businesses. But, other tgan beimg over priced, they hardly carry anything useful, or interesting!!! I LOVE MY AMAZON!!! Sincerely, Kristen Rudd Hopkins county, Kentucky"
Toby Crowther,06/03/2019,1,"Before now I had no problems with the app. However, up until a few weeks ago I started getting an issue where whenever I open the app it showed a dog and said ""Uh oh, something went wrong on our end."" I thought, okay I'll wait. The app will probably update and it will be fixed. Fast forward to today, I contacted Amazon for the 2nd time. I was forwarded to around 7 people in total to only tell me there was little they could do. They then put me on hold and hung up the phone. Time to cancel prime."
A Google user,06/03/2019,2,"I use this app once a week and it's awful. I find I have to flip to the browser version half the time just to get around its horrible ability to search. Its search is so weighted and verging to outright lying to you. from not finding products, to hiding them deep in a list. the same criteria on the website will give you a very diffrent picture. I still use this app for a few convenient things, but never for research."
Chris McDivitt,01/03/2019,1,"update: Almong the worst apps I've every used. After over a year this app is still a horrible experience. It's really laggy and slow overall. I usually have to touch the button 3-4 times to view item details, add to my cart, or view the description; sometimes it doesn't respond at all (using a Pixel 3 phone). It's extremely frustrating."
A Google user,23/02/2019,2,different prices for the same item... *** only 10 items left must buy now then it goes back to normal after you aquire the item.***
A Google user,25/02/2019,1,"Slow, often non-responsive, crashes every other time I try to use it. Complete and utyer garbage, go back to the old app that was clunky but functional."
Greg Malley,02/03/2019,1,"Saved Christmas gift cards for 2 years, then when i found something i wanted and had enough money saved up, i tried to use the gift card. Amazon locked my account and when i called customer service they said they couldnt open my account because it was sent to their fraud department and they refused to transfer me there to verify it was me making the purchase on my account. They also told me it would be 3 days before they could verify my purchase was me. No more Amazon gift cards for me!!"
des des dance,26/02/2019,1,this app has been glitching like made lately. it won't even be running and i will get error messages popping up on my phone. saying the Amazon app is not working...sheesh frustrating.
Steele-Wool,20/02/2019,4,"Update: After some updates, this app is much easier and more pleasant to use. It's not perfect and it still has hiccups, but overall a good improvement. *Old Review*: Amazon as a site is great, but this app is very unresponsive and slow at times and makes browsing/shopping very frustrating. It's easier just to go to the site on my computer or using the web browser on my phone rather than using this app."
Jon Plumley,24/02/2019,1,Associated apps not working. items bought from original Amazon app telling me to sign in to use them. I am signed in but the apps don't seem to recognise it. e.g. ultimate guitar
Sydnei Tomlinson,02/03/2019,1,I loved my prime account until Amazon started censoring the films they offered. It's shocking how quickly they will remove movies when pressured. Modern day book burning. #bringbackvaxxed
awhbordeaux,20/02/2019,1,The Android app ¬£5 voucher offer doesn't work. Tried to buy several Amazon products but the voucher is never applied to the final price. What a fraud.
Hannah Stephenson,22/02/2019,2,I am VERY upset that the orginal app preinstalled on my phone cannot be deleted. I now have an app taking up valuable space on my phone. Why couldnt the orginal be adapted?

Cory Nixon,26/02/2019,4,"love the app. but I can't understand why everytime I open it, it wants to be updated, so I say install, it flashes over to the playstore with no option to upadate, and only 'open' and 'uninstall' are the options?"
Theuns van Dyk,04/03/2019,3,"i love amazon, the simplicity and variety, but this new app sucks! i keeps crashing and crashing my phone. the previous app worked perfectly well. can we have that back please?"
AHK Al-Kaabi,04/03/2019,1,The worst shopping experience I got from this app I spent almost 2 hours to figure out why I can't place order whenever I place it give me can't process your order check local address and wrong payment method. 2 I tried to use reload the Amazon balance thing it said ur process been completed and it removed my payment method.... I tried AliExpress and souq they never say to me check ur info.
Dante Grimm,06/03/2019,1,The app constantly fails to connect. you need 4G or Wi-Fi for it to work. makes it useless for a mobile app.
Jessie Tin,25/02/2019,5,"I buy for everyone at home and the pets. I buy on my lunch break, before bed (in pajamas), or right then and there if I see something is low at home. Within a couple of days it's dropped off at my front door. I haven't had any problems with products. Products are exactly like store bought. There are also way more options and discounts, on here, than at stores. This has really freed up my time and money. I don't have to spend half of my day off, going from crowded store to crowded store."
Lun3y Arevalo,27/02/2019,1,I pay membership for years and realize they hand out info threw 3rd part somehow my packages are being forward to different addresses without my acknowledgement of the seller or Amazon I will not accept that. so finally I will cancel my subscriptions over the years. for this reason.
Dan Watson,28/02/2019,2,good site for buying. only down side is app is very unstable. keeps crashing out after a few moments. only usrful if you know what you want and don't want to browse.
Dale Pickett,21/02/2019,4,"I love Amazon, but, this app keeps asking me to install because it will not be supported üò£, it's a pain. This just started happening every time that I open it.

Jeanne Tomanio,02/03/2019,4,the app works pretty well for my shopping needs but now crashes a lot on my android and eats up battery life supposedly. It flashes a lot which is a little annoying. Not sure why :(
A Google user,03/03/2019,1,Horrible Customer Service! I will not be spending any more money with this Company!
A Google user,04/03/2019,1,"even when I explicitly disabled it, all links from other Amazon countries try to open this app which in turn will ask me to change my country and do nothing when I select No. So I basically cannot check other Amazon's orders on my phone"
Lalena Hernandez,21/02/2019,4,"I like having this app on my phone, I dont like that there is not an option to sign out front and center. i shouldn't have to take 3 extra steps to protect myself, my identity, and my money."
Erica Zarifovic,22/02/2019,4,"Love the app and the convenience of it, however is there an ad free version available for purchase? Tired of random ads FREQUENTLY popping up on my phone."
M W,20/02/2019,1,"Search function is not useful. Also don't appreciate when Amazon makes changes, doesn't tell you what's going on and you waste time trying to figure out what's wrong on your end when it is them the whole time. Very disrespectful of customers time. Not to mention they don' have enough respect to ask you to change your password when they need you to, rather they just tell you your password is incorrect and you waste your time again retyping it in multiple times only to find out it is just them."
A Google user,01/03/2019,1,"Got bug My order just disappeared after few minutes Please fix this. And, the item I ordered cancelled itself Wow magical."
lee boyd,24/02/2019,3,the old one was a lot better new app feels like you have to tap multiple times hangs up slow slow slow. makes me want to go to Walmart. I hate walmart!!! please fix so i can buy stuff again

Ricky,05/03/2019,3,What happened to the drag to wishlist feature? there used to be a wishlist on the bottom of the screen. Then I could drag the product thumbnail to the wishlist. But now the best feature is just missing!
A Google user,07/03/2019,4,When it works it's good Constantly wants me to enter my password but won't pop up google keyboard or SwiftKey. Only works if Uninstalled and Reinstalled.
Stacy Smith,22/02/2019,4,"I've had no problems using the app except every time I open it, it tells me that it's not going to be supported anymore, so I touch Install and it gives me the choice to open or uninstall. So I open and everything is fine, but when is it not going to be fine? When I'm standing in line at Whole Foods with a basket of stuff I can't get a discount on? Why the message every time?"
Sonytheoao T,01/03/2019,1,"Feb update destroyed functionality. App produces blank white screen and locks up, rendering it useless."
Amir Hejazi,20/02/2019,1,why did Amazon take out the sorting option to choose from recently added (high to low) or (low to high) in the wishlist?. What is going on? Is Amazon trying to intentionally sabotage and anger customers which will affect sales!!! Bring the option back please thank you.
Krystine Simone,25/02/2019,5,"Totally love amazon! However, the ""add to list"" button doesnt work well i have to tap the screen like 10 times to add something to a list, you guys might want to fix that"
A Google user,07/03/2019,2,"Amazon is not like it used to be. The last 8 items we bought were either defective, not as advertised or sent the wrong item. It seems there is no quality control. We're just buying expensive junk we have to return and then wait a week for refunds."
Hasan Ekerol,24/02/2019,2,installment confusing.. I only wanted the translator not AMAZON or other Stuff..
Katherine Cabrera,21/02/2019,4,"I love it, very user friendly, the only issue i have had, is that when looking at my lists, or especially when trying to sort the items in them, I can only see top 3. For some reason it wouldnt scroll down below thw third item and in order to access them, I have to use the pc. I would love it if Amazon solved that issue.l"
Lonka R,25/02/2019,1,"confused, I'm being asked to install this version as the old one will no longer be supported but when I visit in here it asked to open the app not to install . everytime I use the app its getting irritating ‚òπ . Any suggestions?"
Michael Tsenter,04/03/2019,2,"When in image view, many items are shown with a grey tint until you zoom in at least a little. Also when in image view, the wishlist below is unresponsive. Same issues for a long time and tried on multiple flagship phones."
John catherall,03/03/2019,1,"Disgusting company, have been charging an account with my card details on for Amazon prime every month for a year or more, I've never had Amazon prime and when I spoke to customer service they were useless and I had to go to the bank to get it stopped from my card had well over ¬£100 off me for no reason and no refund."
Jayd Bedi,25/02/2019,1,"well i tried to cancel my amazon prime membership and it gave me all the offers instead so i was looking at the annual offer decided it was a better deal and chose it, they said it wasnt gonna be charged until 2020 buy i just looked at my bank account and thank god i did they charged me 126 dollars without my knowledge or ever letting me know, if i didnt have the 13 dollars to pay it yhis month why the hell would i have 126 dollars just to spare come one amazon what the hell"
miketucky350,26/02/2019,1,Runs like absolute trash. How can a company with so much money make such a bad app on the #1 selling platform. I bet bet bezos wife recieved all development money in his divorce.
KayLynn Parvin,27/02/2019,1,"Very disappointing. Items will come broken and refunds aren't given properly and if they are, you get charged again. No wonder amazon makes so much money. You get double or triple charged each item. also they charge you for other prime accounts you have no connection to."
Ps121 HE,02/03/2019,1,"a lot og bugs. i.e. whwn i save to cart or move to cart it says my carts empty and I need to restart the app several times. also, i proceed to chrck out choose delivery address and it goes back to my cart. this just repeats over and over"

Bruce Dudek,07/03/2019,1,This version of the app is always crashing. Bring back the old STABLE version. The dog pictures are nice but they are not a very big help.
Simone Galofaro,28/02/2019,1,"molto imprecisa soprattutto nelle consegne. spesso bisogna leggere sempre bene le clausole di spedizione di prime perch√© sono fuorvianti. promessa di spedizione in un giorno quando in realt√† secondo la mia posizione ( che Amazon conosce perfettamente) non √® possibile la spedizione veloce. inoltre bisogna stare molto attenti agli ""sconti"" finti di migliaia di prodotti che vengono alzati di prezzo per poter essere ""scontati"" alla bisogna. deluso:spedizion ""prime"" di un ogg da 600$ in una settimana."
Mark,03/03/2019,1,"This is by far the worst app on my phone. It's borderline unusable-- slow, laggy, crashes constantly, and just a nightmare to use. I'm actually shocked that Amazon would make app this bad"
Project Lexus 2jz 1#,24/02/2019,2,"I am trying to look at some of the photos so I can make a proper purchase but every time when I select the photo it keeps buffering This only happens on this app, this problem really needs to be fixed because I had stopped making purchases because I cannot verify the picture properly that I'm looking at please fix this problem ASAP! please, so I can continue my purchasing I'm currently using Samsung Galaxy S9"

M C,02/03/2019,1,"Just a less useful version of the website. Compared to the website it's clumsy, has reduced functionality, less filter options, not compatible with ebates, app only deals nonexistent in Canada.

carlie_rocker 96,25/02/2019,1,this is the worst app ever everytime i order anything and ive already paid it cancels it on its own im so angry and i am not enjoying it.
Michael Fisher,01/03/2019,3,"So S L O W, don't know if it's because I have an Amazon Alexa and it's comparing notes or what the deal is but this app has become so slow it's frustrating."
Tripti Chaturvedi,05/03/2019,1,its stops working. i try to reinstall by uninstall the reinstall but then ther is an option to update the app. FIX TGE UPDATE OPTION

Jarod M,22/02/2019,1,"Typical Amazon, using a heap of junk app to make you buy a heap of junk. I'll stick to the desktop version for those of us who can afford more than a phone."
Gamer Respawn,26/02/2019,4,"Some small issues, such as loading and search results. Other than that it has many features and is very handy. Good work!"

Captain JimBob,25/02/2019,3,"we are being threatened that we must update or the app will suddenly stop working at all, soon. I have done it 4 times in January. No second time in Feburary. How often will i have to update?"

Tezza Tucker,20/02/2019,2,Would like an easy option put on the app to be able to contact customer service. To make a complaint it runs all around the houses.
Erika Leech,24/02/2019,1,"since the most recent update the app keeps crashing and the search feature is useless. If I try to sort by anything other than featured, 99% of the resulta disappear. Also all the products that come up are usually repeats and then the app goes black and freezes."
Ni√±o Kristoffer,26/02/2019,1,why dont this thing work!??!! i have tried multiple codes like a thousand times whats wrong with this!!!???
Kyle Sherer,28/02/2019,3,"Used to use it extensively, but it feels like quality has slipped in recent months. Their sort features have really taken a nosedive when looking for specific items. I recently started looking to buy a comforter and no matter what options I chose it would almost always show the same products. My assumption is that there's no quality checking going on. Sellers can pick multiple features, regardless of whether their product has it or not, to attract more customers with no repercussions."

MR STARWARS 18,02/03/2019,1,Amazon's customer service is shocking just shop around you can find more items cheaper then on Amazon
Jason Kench,07/03/2019,3,I never order multiple things through the app as there is always issues of displaying the postage breakdown for all the items. Only order on a computer now. One item I purchased cost more in postage than the cost of the item. Maybe this is to push you into being a Prime member.. You remove Tommy Robinsons book shame on you.
Todd Dittman,20/02/2019,1,"they intentionally don't give you a spot to complain about their delivery service. they leave your packages in the rain, at the wrong place, and then lie saying that they gave you the package even though they left it outside for anyone to just steal"
Juan Pereira,21/02/2019,2,"When you search for items, the search results wont use the whole width of the screen if you have set the Android ""display size"" setting to ""small"", so a lot of screen real state is lost (you can only see 1 or 2 items). Browsing amazon in chrome works better as it uses the whole space."
Malory Truman,26/02/2019,3,"What happened?! Suddenly the home button at the bottom of my LG screen isn't available when I'm in the amazon app. I have to turn it off & then back on again. Which, first-world problems, I know, but it's still irritating."

Mariah R,03/03/2019,1,"Numerous things are wrong with this since the last update. If you order eligible items over 25.00 you are not supposed to pay shipping. Using the app means you will pay shipping regardless. In addition you get an error that you are ""not qualified"" to leave a review, despite having been allowed before the last."
Ellen F,06/03/2019,2,You really need to adjust your search engine. I get so many unrelated items for my searches that it makes this app clunky and unenjoyable to use. Most importantly it wastes the customers' time.

A Google user,06/03/2019,1,"Amazon is going downhill fast. The huge influx of foreign and unscrupulous vendors is making shopping through this app a very dicey proposition. When you submit a review to warn others, Amazon protects the vendors by censoring your review, so what's the point of reviews if they can't be trusted? And what's the deal with protecting Islam while allowing products which disparage Christianity? ""F#!k Me Jesus?"" You're selling THAT? If you're going to get political, be consistent."
Dustin Vestal,24/02/2019,1,ordered my very first amazon pkg and its been three weeks.... still havent received. didnt even get an email. when i tracked pkg its just says sorry its late. wait a little longer ... not satisfied with amazon. will most likely not order from them again.

Tammy Jordan,19/02/2019,4,"i love this app and use it often however the last 2 days it will not let me open it at all. I've sent feedback, uninstalled it and installed it again and still nothing. I have about 5 orders coming this week and need to track them and i am not able to. please fix this. its not only this one its all my amazon apps that wont open...music and video."
Sarabeth Reinker,04/02/2019,4,I love shopping on Amazon & the app is pretty good. Only problem is that occasionally when I try to add something to my cart or buy it now on the mobile app it does neither no mater how hard I press on my phone. Also sometimes have problems when trying to see a picture larger. After clicking on it I suddenly get a message that image isn't available. Other than that I'm really happy with Amazon. I especially love Amazon Smile. I wish they would incorporate it into an app. Thank you.
PyroKimmi,04/02/2019,5,"LOVE IT!!! I would like to add some requests for helpful updates. - An option of moving multiple items at once, to other lists. - Permitting kept wishlist items [image/details] visible from total disappearance if listing disappears; it reminds me of what was desired until it appears again. - An option to keep our default wishlist from accidentally being deleted. It happened once and I forgot everything I added to it. Please and thank you!!!"
Jose Santiago,18/02/2019,2,"It's pretty ridiculous how slow and unresponsive this app is. Any time I look at an item that has multiple options, it takes forever to get those options to load. Actually loading times in general here are bad. Playing product videos is always a hit or miss. The Underground app was far superior but that's being discontinued, so here we are."
Fermin Peregrin,14/02/2019,5,"Excellent, easy to use app. It has the right tools to allow to find exactly what are you looking for. They help you if you have any problem with an order and yoy can apply for the amazon store card that allows you to purchase expensive items and pay it off a little bit every month. I love it and I am so happy with this app and amazon."
Kerry's Glam Bag,02/02/2019,5,"OMG WHY HAVEN'T I BEEN USING THIS SOONER! if I need anything not only does Amazon have it, but you get it so quick it makes my head spin. (lol in a good way obviously)"
Naveen Thomas Joseph Stephen Manohar,16/02/2019,1,"Why does Amazon India process your review if you give a low rating for a product while if you give a higher rating, it doesn't say it's processing. Is this to support the sellers for some monetary reasons while customers are ok to suffer with low quality products from sellers? I haven't noticed this type of thing in Amazon US. And I see a big difference in return policies too between the countries"
A Google user,12/02/2019,1,"I loved this app and spent A LOT on Amazon over the years and have had Prime membership all along, but for the past while things have got bad. Deliveries are never on time and they don't respond to emails. So I cancelled Prime. Now I went to buy an item and the price is 19.97, but they offer free delivery for orders over 20.00. That's an absolute con! There is nothing I can buy for 3 pence. So I am deleting the app now and will spend my valuable money elsewhere. Won't be back."
Mark Seidel,06/02/2019,1,"Still hate this app and using the browser to access Amazon is way more comprehensive and detailed. This app is just useless at times. Their 2 day shipping is now just a bad joke. Ads claim 2 day shipping but takes 6 days to receive. Prime shipping is becoming pointless and that's why I have prime, doubtful I'll have it next year."
A Google user,19/02/2019,5,This last update puts everything right again A much needed update to solve issues that had arisen during the last iteration of this app. All seems to have returned to normal and it returns to it's rightful place as one of my personal favorite apps for shopping and browsing products.
Al Moccia,25/02/2019,1,"I loved the old app. ever since oreo was introduced, I have nothing hut problems. every new update won't install. I was unable to use the old app because amazon stopped supporting it and I had an open ticket with Amazon cust sppt. one day all the amazon apps updated, but I'm right back to nothing from Amazon will update. hire some develeopers please."
Mariann Balcar,08/02/2019,3,I ordered headlights to be shipped to me in 2 days and the payment method went through. the day they were supposed to arrive I checked the app to see when they were supposed to arrive and it said the payment method was declined? It would have been fine if your system said that from the beginning or sent me a notification on my phone if something changed!
Danny Keo,09/02/2019,1,"starting to become frustrated with my prime. what's the point of having 2 day shipping if my purchases started getting delayed, or not left at my location on time. They will make it inconvenient by taking it back to their facilities, amd I would have to wait days over the weekend, or until it makes it back!!! getting over this, and we are over charged. same itmes listed for cheaper on ebay, and now they have their own version of prime."
Heidi Hearter,31/01/2019,3,"I love Amazon and the service they provide. What I do not like, and it may be specific to my area and the drivers here, but I cannot stand how often they will say things are delivered when they have not been. They also have a way to say where the items were delivered too and they are never accurate. It would raise my confidence in Amazon if their drivers were saying when they actually deliver the items and the way they deliver it, especially if I'm not home. I hope Amazon sees this"
ZeGlowingMushroom,15/02/2019,1,"Second time ordering something from here. Wanted a refund beacuse my item was late for a few weeks, got my money back. Then the item arrived randomly and I must go places to repackage everything to get to keep my money. Worst experience gettng something online so far."
Eraldo Frost,18/02/2019,3,The market is okay but i still feel like ebay is better as it doesnt feel like the customers are split in two different segments like prime and normal users are here. Also your app icon doesnt stand out its very plain and unnoticeable i often go right past it when looking for the app in my installed applications.
Michael Linhart,13/02/2019,2,App is much better than it use to be when it ate up my battery running in the background. App still has major issues when I try to order some things that are close to sold out. It will say it has placed it in my cart but it hasn't. Seems like only sunny day scenerios are tested.
Steve X,30/01/2019,3,"Recent update seems to have fixed issue noted in ""Previous Review"" below... for now. This badly needs an actual Change History section listing fixes etc. ""What's New"" only has marketing hype. [Previous Review follows] :: Unusable for a few months now... tried several reinstalls, reboots, updates, cache purges, different phones. I search for product, select from list.... app just keeps refreshing over and over, never displays product. Have to use browser to shop amazon."
Kai Williams,15/02/2019,2,"This is significanlty worse than the old Amazon app. It's slow and laggy and keeps ramdomly switching around my default settings. I never had this problem with the old app, but after I got a new phone I couldnt download the old one. 2 stars because Amazon itself is great, but this app runs terribly and there was nothing wrong with the old one."
A Google user,29/01/2019,1,"My least favorite way to shop. App features include never actually finding exactly what I'm looking for unless someone wants THAT specific to found ON SALE. 2-day shipping is a lie, whether you pay for it or with prime. Someday my review won't be an outlier. It will be the norm and it will be instantly deleted everywhere simultaniously by Alexa through the AWS platform. And even then, I still won't be able to find what I need. -_-'"
Damian England,30/01/2019,4,"Nice shopping experience, although I hate that when you try and search for sexual adult products through the application, it only shows a few items, even if you try to refresh it. You guys need to fix this, so that sexual products can be browsed with ease. I dont know if you guys hide the search from the app,but you need to fix this issue #Amazon."
Joel Armendariz,19/02/2019,4,"I love amazon, but there's just one thing that's making me give a 5 star. The thing is that sometimes the app bugs out and I can't even open up the app at times. I have to restart my phone to make the app work.. please fix this üòä"
Emily Chambers,12/02/2019,3,The old app used to work better. This new one doesn't let u do things the old one did. It freezes and I'm not able to scan any of my gift QR codes to send a thank you note the barcode scanner doesn't work I really wish I never deleted the old one it worked flawlessly
John L,10/02/2019,1,"Totally worthless in Australia. I haven't been able to find a single thing on Amazon Australia that is actually cheaper than eBay or retail stores. It became even worse when Amazon decided to collude with the Australian Government and decided to ban Australians from purchasing from the overseas Amazon sites. This results in higher prices showing on Amazon Australia more often than not, and is basically a price gouging platform for sellers to continue to rip off Australians."
Gale Hill,31/01/2019,5,"I absolutely love my Amazon Prime! I don't know how I did without it for so long. Anything I could possibly need, from literally A to Z, is at my fingertips and the best when it comes to shipping. Amazon has it down. There is not one thing I can think of to complain about. Amazon has my complete loyalty."
romie seng,13/02/2019,1,"never using Amazon again , someone tried purchasing things with my card as soon as I put my info on there , it didnt happen once , but twice. fraud prevention called me 2 times for purchases I never made."
Rohan Ganvir,18/02/2019,1,"WORST EXPERIENCE PURCHASING ONE PLUS 6T MOBILE Dear Amazon team member, Last spoken to escalation member about cancellation of my mobile delivery order by the seller. If some senior member can listen to the call recordings and review it that will be helpful to other team member and Amazon. Last team member sha** was not very helpful. He appeared to trying to save himself by just giving information and not answering specific issue. I did not find him to be working for Amazon ."
BOLTS,30/01/2019,5,"Please for the love of God fix the authentication issue! When I try to check my orders it tells me that ""This device could not be authenticated. Please try again (3)"". The only way around this is to go home and then login in which I am already logged in and then it will allow me to view my orders!! I have no problem with the app on my tablet. But this authentication issue is driving me crazy on my S7!! Please please please fix."
A Google user,10/02/2019,5,"Have purchased lots of products, only had one item damaged. Amazon sent the replacement the very next day, now that is Great Service! I'm a big Fan of Amazons price comparisons, and the ease of navigating their site. Thanks Amazon you put em' all to shame in customer service. clay"
A Google user,09/02/2019,2,Better then Creigslist. Its not garanteed to be an honest and accurate deal but they supposedly help make things right. Still new and have 2 out of 3 new unopened vs the phone that was used and insides were striped (screws were bent) from someone tampering with insides. The add said new and with warranty but only the correct item if it was entirely still as built was true.
chris nervi,07/02/2019,3,"Since the Android app update, whenever I go to buy something via one click, I am prompted to enter my password, and then it just loops between hitting 'buy item' and 'enter password.' If I add something to my cart, and then proceed to checkout and buy it everything's fine. This issue seems to have appeared after the latest update."
B R I Z Y,19/02/2019,5,"This is my favorite place to shop for items online. I have not bought any clothes because I dont trust any site to buy my clothes. Amazon has free shipping and a large selection of 1 particular item that you are personally looking for. The ratings really help decide what to get and what not to get. I recently ordered somethi g and it never showed up. I called the customer service and they sent the money right back to me. That made me very satisfied, and it is why I will continue to use Amazon:)"
John Gutkind,09/02/2019,1,worst app ever. doesnt recognize beaverton or kawartha lakes postal codes. try to contact customs service. and need to log in. but I cant because trying to make an account and I need a postal code. my 1 star stand firm until this changed
Dave Slender,15/02/2019,1,"My one and only complaint is that the app almost always runs so bad that its completely unusable, and even when it does run it's so slow to use I dont bother for more than a couple minutes. Something is seriously wrong with this app and I dont recommend it at all. I'm on a galaxy s9 so it shouldn't be a device issue."
A Google user,18/02/2019,1,I tried this app and was confused after I signed up. I tried Chat and customer service called but the individual was not knowledgeable. First and DEFINITELY THE LAST TIME! HORRIBLE SINCE UPDATED I CANNOT SEE SIZE DETAILS ON 2 PLUS SIZE WOMEN COATS. I AM REMOVING BUT BEFORE I REMOVE FROM MY DEVICE I AM DEACTIVATING THIS AMAZON ACCOUNT! THEN REMOVE THIS üêÇüí© APP!
Dahn Alan,16/02/2019,1,"just pics of dogs saying 'something went wrong at our side'. i called amazon and they have acknowledged a technical fault and told me it will be solved in two days as their teams know. anyway two weeks later and all i get are bloody pics of dogs everytime i use the app. to make matters worse, amazon asked me for the dogs name then were shocked when i told them that there is no name, just the error and a dog. feel like Amazon are taking the piss out of me here..."
Magdalen C,03/02/2019,4,"I like the ""more like this"" and the ""customers also buy this"" features so I can compare products and/or consider associated products. I'm irritated that I could NEVER find information as to whether the products are brand new, or refurblished, or open box in any ads. Generally it is an OK app. AliExpress app is slightly better in terms of userbility."
Rebecca Schoonover,30/01/2019,3,not many issues using the shopping part of it but everytime I click done Prime app closed due to an error. So for the last year can't watch any Prime shows or movies. So what am I paying for? I just did the mandatory update it recommended and the program is still not working. Must uninstall
Scott Wiggins,09/02/2019,4,I love the free two day shipping with Prime and being able to watch movies and TV shows for free on our TCL Roku TV app. The only thing I hate is the app being unresponsive/ not loading the home page or an item when I click on it which is becoming too often. Everyone saying there's no difference between Prime and paying for two day shipping is wrong. A subscription by month or yearly pays for itself with free shipping if you use it somewhat often but some people don't comprehend that.
Jorge Ruiz,18/02/2019,1,After the Update the app uninstalled itself and now just lags on a black screen cant even log in to my account i have to use chrome or another browser to log in to mg account what are you guys doing here if something aint broken dont fix it test the apps out better. Samsung S8+ has enough power to handle the app yet here i am cant log inüò°üò°üò°
Amy Mertz,06/02/2019,3,I would give it 5 stars but since there's no option to use amazon smile I'm only giving it 3. I would love to support my selected organization using a convenient app but that's still not an option. So disappointed.
Andy Best,14/02/2019,2,"I used to use underground which ran fine but had to upgrade to shopping. This is soooooooo slooooow in comparison. You would think the current offering would be better, but I would switch back in a heartbeat if I could. Why does this app have to be so slow. I use my pc where possible."
Tony Edwards,14/02/2019,1,"I wish that I could give the a zero! have been a loyal customer for years. sense I started shopping on amazon there customer service has got continually worse and so has there shipping. It may be free but not guaranteed like they say. should take 2months to get a package, no matter where it comes from. Don't believe in there guarantees, you will have to deal with a multitude of CS agents and even after a week or 2 of dealing with the issue you are not guaranteed to guarantee. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!"
Wes C,03/02/2019,4,Amazon is the standard when it comes to ordering anything. It list products that other companies just dont have and with that tech its very user friendly. Most used to compare prices even at the brick and mortar stores.
Paul Lewis,19/02/2019,1,Why on God's green earth are you needing every permission allowed? This is getting worse the more I try to use Amazon. Now we have QR codes that UPS cannot read and making everything more difficult on the user while they make money off of selling our data. I'M DONE! CANCELLING PRIME AND GETTING AS FAR AWAY FROM THESE SCAMMERS DISGUISED AS PROVIDING BENEFITS!
Sam,07/02/2019,1,shi*hole of a company never again will i buy from them and do everything in my power to deter others from using them. the customer service level seem to be getting horrible like ebay. too big and talking to reps in foriegn countries that have no authority other than look at a tracking number for you. well played my amazon management.
kathy jo morris,10/02/2019,5,wonderful fast service and delivery. we lost our dog had 30lb bag of dog food they had delivered they took off credit card said dont worry about returning and they gave condolences. pretty nice for a big company and they replied immediately they have my business. i hate shopping its wonderful shopping at home
Tara Kirk,11/02/2019,1,"Amazon is the worst company. AWFUL customer service. Not to mention, their jerk drivers who just toss my packages then hop back in their 1991cadillac. i have 5 fire sticks, 4 alexas, 2 of the kid fire tabs and after so many bad customer service experiences, they have officially lost my family and i as customers. We will take our business elsewhere. As for you, amazon, do not try to get me to contact you for any resolution to this issue. you had many chances to do better but you didnt."
Lisa Leemans,01/02/2019,2,The app runs very slowly on my Pixel 3 and gets hung up when try to progress through the shopping experience. The chat feature is useless. Did not answer my problem and no way to redirect it.
Mattais,09/02/2019,1,Amazon is a rip off. the shipping is far to costly and i once tried to order $30 earbuds and they had $15 dollar shipping. I often recieved the wrong item or it had issues. I know there are many misconceptions about eBay which is what i mainly use that i want to clear up. If you receive the wrong item eBay will give you your money back even if the seller refuses. the most i have payed on shipping is $2 and there are amazing deals. i got every dragon ball series for $50 brand new. Use eBay!
A Google user,02/02/2019,3,The best online shop but they did mess up my orders a few times but they do redeem themselves and give money back. Most products in great condition. I give them a 3/5. If my nedt orders come in faster. ill rate this higher
Emy Kuntzman,10/02/2019,1,"i ordered four items the week before christmas. not only did they not arrive on the specified dates, when i called amazon to fix the problem, they couldn't refund me. they emailed the sellers and the sellers told me because one of the items was custom, it could not be refunded because it was a personalised piece. two weeks later, i ordered something different. not only did it ACTUALLY arrive ON TIME, the driver signed for my brother!! they aren't authorised EVER to do so!!"
A Google user,11/02/2019,3,"While liking the app and most of it's features, I feel that the bar code reader need lots of work. I use it to compare prices when I shop B&M stores. when it works, It takes a while for it to focus. Moody of the time i give up in frustration. I've used the Walmart app for the same and as soon as it's near the barcode, I get the decoded info."
Tien Nguyen,15/02/2019,3,"I am Primer for long time. It was good first couple years, always delivery right time. in 2018 and now, it is terrible. You always get products late. And customer service is suck as well. so dissapointed abt this company. i started to stop shopping by amazon."
A Google user,19/02/2019,4,***update** now working correctly thank you. . . Won't let me sign in. Keeps saying check internet connection even when connected to WiFi or on data. Rubbish.
Brit Howell,11/02/2019,2,"Amazon seems unwilling to post negative reviews on their products. None of my reviews of 3 stars or less have posted, due to rule violations. However, those 'violations' don't apply to my positive reviews."
Jenniii Pink,19/02/2019,2,"I enjoy using the app but, everything has turned into and feels forced into Prime now. I've noticed most of everything I want to purchase never has any free shipping anymore. It's really rare to have a free shipping option. I can't afford to get Prime. Amazon has really taken over, stores have closed down. It just makes me sad. Things are no longer the same anymore. Amazon was cool before but now it's gone too far. I've started to just buying local products in my state or near me."
Ken Jones,08/02/2019,1,"Worse than the legacy app! Why would you fix if it isn't broken? All around clunky, transition between sections are slow, slide out menu is not smooth. No good. Better off using it on your desktop."
Jace McClure,10/02/2019,4,"Love amazon but i wish i could input my clothing sizes on my profile and be shown the price of my size first. I see shoes i like and they say ""starting at $19.99"" then find out that is for a size 6 mens, and my size costs $95.00. It simply makes me waste my time scanning through clothing and choosing my sizes until i find something reasonably priced."
erica estell,02/02/2019,5,"I love the convenience of shopping on Amazon and the speedy delivery I get with Prime. Returning items is quick, easy and most of the time free. The products Ive ordered have been of good quality too. When I cant find something I know I can always turn to amazon to get what I want."
David Jones,07/02/2019,1,"When using one-click to order an item, the item is double ordered and I have to cancel one order. This is the third time this has happened with Amazon and happens each time I use one-click. I have called each time and Amazon hasn't been able to provide any data about app usage or from which device the item was ordered. Customer service response on this issue has been found wanting. This is a major bug and will burn you if you order an expensive item with one-click."
Kellie Toth,01/02/2019,3,Overall a good app except you need to spend $50 in the app to be able to review products.. which sucks because I was super excited to review the products I ordered. I also can't get through influencers pages through the app which is dumb. Would like to add a picture to my pets profile.
A Google user,16/02/2019,1,"Android App constantly freezes, links often don't open, and I hate how it sometimws automatically redirects from effective web browsing/shopping. It used to work great on my Iphone. This app honestly pisses me off. I hope an update to fix all the bugs is released soon. For now, I'm disabling it."
Candy Girl,31/01/2019,1,every time I open the app it give a note that support of this app will stop soon installe the latest when I hit installe it takes me google play but it only gives me two option uninstalle and open. I removed the app and installed it again the same issue. this is very annoying.
t voo,12/02/2019,1,"This app is the absolute worst. It wouldn't even let me go to checkout, customer service was slow and stupid. I wish I could give it no stars."
Lionel Saliou,14/02/2019,1,"uninstalled never to be ran again. As of today, Amazon UK is not available (as a site) or functioning as an application when running a VPN ( we are on PIA), unforgivable (we tried on multiple handsets). Prime membership is set for renewal next month... now we seriously thinking about dropping that too. Some say it is to combat fraud, i say it is squeezing customers more by tracking and data mining them. enough is enough. 0 star not an option... c'mon Google"
Higher Standards,20/02/2019,1,After latest update.. it crashes when clicking on interesting things...well programmed updates from a billion dollar company AND YOU WANT ACCESS TO MY CONTACTS?! DATA MINING MOTHE3RFUC#ERS
rebecca sonier,11/02/2019,4,"overall shopping experience is great, broad selection and fast accurate shipping. I actually have very little problems considering the amount of items I've ordered. I have 4/5 stars only because of outsourced customer service. the language barrier is sometimes a pain in the a**"
Jody Loeser,14/02/2019,3,I would do 5 but I'm in a battle with Amazon. they will not give me an answer to one simple question...which I've asked through numerous phone conversations... why have I been banned from the community. I've done nothing wrong and I feel my rights are being violated by one of the richest men in the world. Funny thing is they still take my money. Where do I go from here? Anyone?
A Google user,03/02/2019,1,"Like many other recent complaints, the app is functionally useless. It won't load content, buttons don't work. Just when it seems to be working again, bam, won't load content. Massive waste of time."
Rachel O,31/01/2019,1,"Pityful. open app and it doesn't download. All you see is the bar move from left to right as if it was downloading page but never does. Still use old app no problems but showing to use this one, pretty annoying. Will continue to use old app until it will stop working."
A Google user,03/02/2019,1,"I have been a prime member for over two years now and I have purchased multiple Fire TV products, Echo, Eufie Geenie, Fire tablets including the Echo Buttons. I have invited friends and family to become members. Let's just say I love Amazon and being an Prime member. with that said I write this review with heavy heart to say why is it so hard to get a refund on a cancelled order that was not even shipped and delivered to my door?"
Angie Alexander,01/02/2019,1,literally will not let me check out an order because of the new add on feature. it is making me place an order for more than 25 dollars just to qualify for free shipping when i dont want that and only want to buy two things. very annoying üòê
Heidi Smith,03/02/2019,5,saved a ton of money for a birthday present for my son and got free shipping and everything. this helped me to keep within my really really tight budget plus be able to ship it and everything for free especially because my son lives out of state. I didn't have to worry about shopping on Walmart and worry about choosing between site to store making my son's aunt have to go and pick it up or having to spend way too much money just to get free shipping on my son's birthday gift. thanks Amazon.
Shawn McTear,09/02/2019,4,"Great over all, as it much easier then the mobile website. one thing that could be improved it's the app's icon. It currently is not an adaptive icon, so it looks out of place on newer versions of android."
Dana Smithson,16/02/2019,1,"When using the app I attempt to click on an item an continue to get amazons error"" uh oh our pg isn't working with the pic of a different dog each time"". Its hard to read about a potiental product i'm interested in when i can't get to the pg info because of that constant error msg. PLEASE fixüò°"
Tim Chavez,08/02/2019,1,"Under ""Innovative Products"".. marketing at the btm of the page... Every time I click on a category .. usually based on the picture. I am taken to something totally disconnected from that picture. So the product I thot I would be sent to, is nowhere to be found. This is way too much like bait and switch. Fix it quickly plz."
Jack Daniels,12/02/2019,2,"You can't get a tracking number until the package shows delivered. If it is not delivered, lost for some reason, you don't have the tracking number to do anything on your own. The turquoise tracking chart is... useless. Who thought of this?"
Underground Open Mic Channel,16/02/2019,1,"horrible trying to use this app. I'm putting in the right email, the right phone number, everything is wrong for some reason. You cant contact customer service. Dont even bother. POS."
eddie,18/02/2019,4,"Has a notification that says ""You haven't bought yet."" By far this is most weirdest notification message I've ever seen. Isn't that kind of a ride thing to say? But besides that, it's an alright shopping with a nice layout."
Jake Brown,06/03/2019,2,They have everything. But the shipping is consistently poor. I get used items sold as new. Don't even bother with customer service. A poor example of American business. Good luck if you speak English.
Greg Williams,08/02/2019,1,"I'm very confused about how this works. trying to find a bike. gave this site one star, because this is as low as I can rate them"
Jackson Callaghan,08/02/2019,3,"Overall interface is ok. The search function is a bit strange in how it deals with the back button but is acceptable. one recurring issue is that I have notifications set on, order things regularly, and have literally never received a notification indicating when my package has arrived, or any other shipment updates."
ClarissA Carson,02/02/2019,1,it would be nice to have an option for US only considering the last 3 clothing things I've bought I ordered 2 sizes bigger and they don't fit and not to mention when u put stuff in your cart the shipping date says one thing then after you pay u get an email stating a way out further date then initially told. if I wanted all stuff from China I'd just go to Walmart
Edward Danks,05/02/2019,2,"as much help it is, it's all contingent on the app loading and working the way it's supposed to. every time I use it, I have to reload it 2 or 3 times. I go to place an order and it doesn't load. I want to add to a shopping list and it crashes."
waddih1990,12/02/2019,2,"Amazon is awesome, but the app keeps crashing on my phone. When it start up it lags real hard and it takes forever to get to my cart. This has been happening recently. A couple of months before this review, the app was perfectly smooth"
Koala Bear,30/01/2019,4,"so far so good. but seeing lots of stuff that we used to have, and now its ""Amazon prime only"" is just disrespectful..."
Joseph Graves,01/02/2019,1,"works good for a day or 2, then starts to freeze. I've tried re downloading the app like 8 times and does the same thing every time. Garbage."
Lacretia Smith,15/02/2019,1,"I tried to log into my account to order an item and it completely locked me out. Now it keeps asking to log in with a temporary password but once i do it, it says invalid or password not correct."
Tommy Olofsson,07/02/2019,2,"no benefit from using the mobile website, and you cant change the language to english. So for me its just easier to use amazon on chrome with google translate. And the 5‚Ç¨ incentive for using the app that they give you doesn't work"
Kim Doss-Cortes,10/02/2019,1,"""Support for this app will stop soon,"" but I can't uninstall it because the trash at Amazon has convinced my carrier to make it impossible to do. Go to hell, Amazon. This is now a worthless app taking up space on my phone, and you want me to install ANOTHER app? GFY"
Bryce Jackson,12/02/2019,1,"app is super slow and laggy, for the price that Amazon is going up to you would think they could keep the Amazon underground app that was awesome. but no forced to pay more for less then stellar service."
Ben Jammin,16/02/2019,1,really slow for an app made by such a big company. i know it's not my phone because other apps are very snapy
Cindy Wright,29/01/2019,5,Living in Hi. everything costs so much for shipping. Amazon Primes free shipping makes it possible to order most things on line. It's the best way to shop especially when you don't drive.
abeski,08/02/2019,2,Unprofessional Amazon delivery drivers. Your delivery driver nearly gave my mom a heart attack. She thought he was a thief. You need to do a better job as a company to properly equip your drivers with professional amazon uniforms. The vehicle was just a white van with no indication it was Amazon's. It was your delivery driver but to insure their safety you should equip them properly. I have a giant dog and you dont know who could be armed.
A Google user,14/02/2019,2,This is the worsted app have ever seen because if you search for goods it will give you different things not what you are looking for. if you downloaded it you are just wasting your time and your data please don't download please jumia is better please.
Summer Berger,16/02/2019,2,"Every time I open this app, it asks me there is an update, so when I click on Install, it brings me to google play and there isn't an Update button, just Open. When I click Open, it brings me to the updated version. It's getting annoying."
A Google user,05/02/2019,2,This app needs an update badly. The app is unresponsive at times. Other times the app will just freeze the force close. Better off just using chrome and giing tno the website.
Ugljesa Lalic,07/02/2019,1,"in my country best option is Amazon.UK or Amazon. it (italy) , Amazon UK you can't change currency to euro and Amazon.it language is in Italian and not available in English.... (Amazon world wide has way to expensive shipping) please fix it."
Daniel Brown,06/02/2019,1,Amazon is a great company this app however freezes/fails to load pages constantly on my Note 8.. Everytime I shop I end up having to restart the app several times just to finish ordering something. Fix your app Amazon!
AleX V.,15/02/2019,1,"Ever since update.... Constant ""uh oh something went wrong"" *update* yet another update.... And still ""something went wrong"" all the time. Also, ever since problems started, it keeps declining my card that I've had for a while. Yes i updated it when card got updated, yes i have money available to spend on it.... Still issues 2/13/19 - Two updates later... still same issues."
Ethan Bausch,19/02/2019,1,"I like the old version better. My lists are not there when I want to drag an item to it. It seems to be glitchy and slow. Also, when I login to the updated version my lists didn't transfer, so everything I had saved was lost."
Bill McCullough,04/02/2019,2,"I have updated this app many times. Every time I go to use it, I receive a message requiring me to update it again. Poor programming. What else was done poorly? Security? Privacy? Those don't make money, so screw the user."
jenelle anderson,03/02/2019,1,"oh. Comes preinstalled on my phone, but I get an error notice that it is no longer supported and asks me to upgrade. When I do, a SECOND app is installed, but this one is connected to the phone, so I can't see or use the NEW one."
Dave Ubermensch,16/02/2019,4,"seriously ugly as sin. when everyone else is offering a dark mode, amazon is forcing everyone to only have this ugly as fudge seafoam green skin. your asthetics team has their finger so far away from the pulse it's up where the sun doesn't shine."
MrZythFx,30/01/2019,1,"scum bags need every dime you can get eh? it's a good thing no one in customer service ever speaks English as a first language, otherwise I might be able to find out why I'm getting screwed by useless deals and free shipping but if you press this button we secretly add 4 dollars!"
Jacob K.,17/02/2019,1,"It's gotten to wear there is ALWAYS a problem with my order to the point where it would just about be cheaper to drive an hour to the closest city that has the items I want to order rather than deal with duplicate items, items that break, and items that just can't be returned for no apparent reason... It's ridiculous."
Jessica Batallan,01/02/2019,1,Horrible! Ive been having a hard time w something so simple. followed allong w the steps and no reward. extremelly frustrating!
Rock C C Conway Jr,04/02/2019,2,Why the hell does the App keep telling me to download the new version because the old one will no longer be supported then when I click on DOWNLOAD for the NEW VERSION it says I already have it? Cant your website recognize that and quit telling me to download the NEW VERSION?

Shelly Nelson,15/02/2019,2,App itself is fine does what it needs to to buy ... but the constant notifications for recommend deals are rubbish. Stuff I would never in a million years buy so its a waste of time. Wish they would actually tailor the notifications and let you rate how relevant yo you it is or turn these off all together. It just makes me angry that ive wasted my time going into something in would never want or need.
Skeeter,16/02/2019,1,"App is garbage. Takes for ever to load, if it ever loads (I am on wifi and mobile site works fine) Continously tells me something went wrong and have to start searchin again from the home screen."
karen simpson,13/02/2019,4,"As other people have stated, won't let me choose colour or sizing, just get a yellow wheel! Please fix as I can't buy anything, whereas before it was a brilliant app, so efficient and convenient!! Update! brilliant app, once it was fixed, it's been brilliant! I do all my shopping on it, no problems!"
BlueSialia,11/02/2019,2,App can't open supported links. It's a hassle to find an offer elsewhere and manually search for it in the app because clicking on the link will open the browser regardless of your configuration.
James Wyly,13/02/2019,1,"App is very low quality, ui elements are extremely unresponsive. Add to Cart button rarely works on my device, almost always hsve to reload pages multiple times or give up and order on desktop. Would never use this app if i didnt badically have to"
Tony Steele,19/02/2019,1,"I wish this app would work. Every time I try to use it I get ""UH-OH something went wrong on our end ""."
A Google user,10/02/2019,3,"*Edit: Wish the app worked better, have to tap the UI at least several times before anything happens. *Moreover, upon setting up my account, there's provisions to personalize your shipping preferences; ""item to be left at your door"" was the 1 I chose, however, my package (that was too large for my apartment complexes' mailbox) was left at the front door of the complex... exposed to the 60+ tenants I share that hallway with... Thank God they're an honest lot, that was *extremely unprofessional."
Kalynn Chang,15/02/2019,1,"It is in very poor taste that a company this big has a charity option (Amazon Smile), but chooses not to allow that in their app. Apps are usually for convenience, however, it is only available on the website."
Benjamin Padilla,15/02/2019,4,"This app is pretty good. Not perfect but good. It's layout is good. I like the ""similar items consumers viewed"" based on what I'm currently looking at. That's extremely helpful when trying to find the best deal."
Adam Brooks,01/02/2019,1,Worst return policy I've ever delt with. It used to be easy to return product but now it is nearly impossible and they make you jump through hoops.
Perla Vazquez,04/02/2019,5,"DONT believe the bad reviews. It's mainly just people who dont actually know how to use the app: A. ""I have Amazon prime but for some items I still have to pay for 2 day shipping"" no stupid, only items under ""Prime"" are free shipping. that's my it's called ""prime membership"" B. ""customer service is rude and doesn't help at all"" their literal job is to help you, if they are rude it is definatly because you were being an annoying b*tch. Trust me, it's ALWAIS the customer's fault."
Sallie Shows,16/02/2019,5,Amazon rules! its like online walmart but better. I can get my favorite hot sauces from California on Amazon. Tastes like LA! Try Pico Pica red or green So amazing!
Alex Ruimy,02/03/2019,1,"how can Amazon release a web wrapper app? it's brutally, impossibly slow. just let me give you my money faster!"
A Google user,02/02/2019,1,Everytime I open this app I get a message telling me it's going to be obsolete and I need to get the new version. When I try to get the new version by clicking the button it takes me to the page where it just says open the app. No new virsion. No install. So annoying.
Brenton Sherwood,15/02/2019,1,"Never works. Every time a page opens i can see the content for 1 second and then a picture of a dog pops up and it says ,""Oops. Something went wrong on our end."" It's been happening for over a year and never works."

Max Jessen,03/02/2019,1,"Tried it again, soo many issues Claims I'm not prime member. It does not show earlier purchases. If I use web page I get free or low cost shipping, in the app it is between en 50 and 300 % on top of the purchase price, as in item costing 18$ with a shipping fee of 53$ that seems ridiculous. The web page shows price in local currency, the app doesn't. And so on... I think it is because they do not focus on my country yet, and it is a small country so..."
Fhelix Gamer,04/02/2019,1,"Horrible I bought 5 items and only one came in, and guess what I couldn't even get my money back! I threw away a total of $200 dollars. Horrible service I wish I could rate this app below 0"

Barkat Rezae,02/02/2019,1,the worst returning process ever. you made a mistake of sending me wrong and i have to pay for the return shipping? you serious is this the new way to make money. this is the first and last time i will order anything from amazon.

David Robinson,02/02/2019,1,still asking to uodate. recent update continually want to install new update even with dismissing the message. I've uninstalled restarted phone and reinstalled app and no change. getting to be a pain
A Google user,31/01/2019,2,Better than previous version. But still times out quite a lot unlike other apps eg eBay. Guess what that does to my shopping habits....
aggie veikoso,05/02/2019,2,"just downloaded the app but it seems to be playing up. Managed to search the items but a minute after the results pop up, it refreshes and goes back to its home page. This happened a few times, so I just gave up."
Alex Jones,03/02/2019,3,Excellent customer service. Fast delivery. Will take 2 stars for having its founder meddling in politics and not minding his business (of selling).
Carlo Fantozzi,31/01/2019,1,"Amazon use to have good customer service, but I guess they got too big for their own good. They only look out for their third party merchants and the customer reviews are rigged. If I could give zero stars I would."
Dr Mark Helfand,03/02/2019,2,"The app plays music well. The rest of it is horrible. I got it with Prime so it was free. However, downloading music, buying music, deleting music is a nightmare. I can search for a song online, buy it & download it. But when I search for it offline, after all that, it isn't offline. What a mess. I only use it because it's free."
A Google user,13/02/2019,1,"Terrible customer service. I just want my product that I bought, so I never have to deal with Amazon anymore!"
Michael Richardson,30/01/2019,1,I've been a prime member for over four year Amazon take their membership fee at my account every month but for some reason when I order something I can't get anything in 2 days I mean I get some things but I've been waiting on a package since Sunday and it's Wednesday and still no update on when I'm gonna receive it I called customer service about it they act like they didn't care what I was what I was saying canceled my membership I would never order anything again you lost a customer
A Google user,19/02/2019,1,"For people shopping internationally, I just wanted to get some UK products but they are limited here and the rates are terrible. Nothing that interesting for the listing. I'm guessing this is more of a daily needs shopping for Americans"
Danny Scalf,13/02/2019,1,"When goods are not delivered (but paid for), Amazon Prime deletes the item, so accountability can't be tracked. This practice actually enables disreputable sellers (most often from outside the US)."
Carey Litz,30/01/2019,1,"spent $150, never got my package or return money. I contacted both seller and amazon both haven't offered any help. its been six months and amazon says ive already complained once. so i guess i just lost my money"
Adiel Cohen,30/01/2019,5,My love for Amazon prime equals that of this app. It works fluently and is able to keep up with all the orders without causing disorder. I have yet to have an issue with it.
Jason Libby,11/02/2019,1,The updated app crashes constantly. I never had an issue with previous Amazon apps.
John Rodrigues,04/02/2019,1,"keeps coming up that I need to update. go to the play store and no updates. uninstall and reinstall, cleared cache and data. same nonsense. update installed. stopped for a day. happening again."
David Mull,04/02/2019,2,it sucks because it keeps telling me my current app will go out of use and to download the new app! I did and I have so where's the new app?
William Duran,31/01/2019,5,Loved the app but just got the new Note 8 and the app will not open. Ge5s stuck on main screen that says Amazon. Please fix
George Jose,09/02/2019,1,"sub menu options sometimes do not respond when clicked. like changing the quantity, size or color of an item. its been like this for months and is worse now. Is this really expected from an app from one of the most valuable companies in the world??"
Mark Bensink,09/02/2019,1,First time I've ever felt compelled to write a review. This app is useless. Every time I open it the app says support will soon end and gives an option to install new app. Clicking only takes you to the same app in the app store. Sometimes there is the option to upgrade sometimes not. Upgrading seems to make it worse. The app does nothing but crash now. Total piece of expletive!
Bo≈°tjan Bele,15/02/2019,1,"Not usable! When I start the app, first I get asked to choose the right amazon (using amazon.de), then I should login. Login is not possible, because the app says I have no internet (what is not true). then I skip the login and get surprised with pics of dogs with the sentence ""Oops! Something went wrong"". This error was first seen last quarter of the last year! Errors may happen, but not repairing them is IMO the worst thing."
Nick Diamanti,18/02/2019,3,hangs up cant even open it right. now dont know why restarted phone so its def. not my end
Chris McDannold,20/02/2019,2,"WHERE ARE THE RELEASE NOTES?! Another update, another plug for a feature instead of describing what was added or fixed with the update. Why do app devs believe that it is ok to release updates without actual release notes?"
James Brousseau,15/02/2019,1,do not get iteam by promised 2 day shipping it's a joke you always get late due to lazy employees not doing their job so you get delivery when promised by you pay all this money for prime and when you buy an iteam because delivery date promised they change when ordered and don't ship till it's a day late at least so don't order something cause it says it will be here in 2 days cause it wont
jojo warden,04/02/2019,5,So far I haven't had any problems with their service or any deliveries!!! As far as I'm concerned 5 star all the way.
Jim Monroe,11/02/2019,1,"I have not been able to sign in to my account using my phone. Message says the password is incorrect, yet I can sign in via my computer. Frustrating, I tend to use my phone more than my computer."
Amber Honkomp,11/02/2019,3,I am having trouble purchasing the things I bought on Amazon with my giftcard. I'm rather annoyed. I keep on getting emails saying to update my information. why won't my gift card work?
Cobuscus G,14/02/2019,1,"I tried to order something, had just enough money, check Amazon the next day told me to ""review payment options"" so I did checked my card balance and this has taken a pound off for no reason, wouldn't recommend"
Beverly Maierson,16/02/2019,3,"just not the best app. feel it could be designed better. it also keeps telling me I need to update, when I already have. very annoying."
Apryl Pohlman,05/02/2019,1,"Too many times lately my packages arrive late. Guaranteed by a certain day and they don't show. Once again package is late. They couldnt tell me where it was or why it was late. Was suppose to come USPS, and ironically after speaking with customer service I get an update saying its now coming in next day air from the sake location it was supposedly shipped out of this weekend. No offer for a refund just a $5 to next purchase."
Carmen Martinez,04/02/2019,5,I love this app. i use this app every day and any time I want. I can check my list of things I want to buy and receive alerts when prices change and are lower. I recommend this app to all Amazon fans and everyone.
Mark Powell,02/02/2019,2,More ways to make Mr Bezos richer beyond comprehension. Tricked out of a promotional discount because I completed a purchase outside this app.
Lucy Owusu,31/01/2019,5,"This app is good an the best to riliable that i admire to my friends to follow this app, i buy something en the venditer sent me difrent thing that am not expeted ,infact i was desperate of my money being wasted ,Amazon has arshuor me that my money will pay back by venditer an thir words are treu ,a very big thanks you"
R D,13/02/2019,2,Clunky app. Buttons randomly don't work. The app is pretty slow. This is on an s9+. Incredible that Amazon can't even get an Amazon shopping app right. Like how??
LesB,02/02/2019,4,"Most Improved since Stupid "" Recommendations "" are removed ! Lists, controlled by User are Very Useful ! Prime MEMBERSHIP is Good BUT Getting Too expensive. User Checkout is GOOD !"
Julianna Reader,18/02/2019,1,"the update causes this app not to work. as soon as I open it it says ""uh oh, something went wrong on our end"". it's been like this since Jan 28 and hasn't been fixed. extremely frustrating and disappointing"
Cheryl Kaye,30/01/2019,2,having issues with the app. will not open. says problem is on your end but then tells me to check my connection. nothing wrong with my connection.

Dena Mehrens,04/02/2019,4,"most times u can find what your looking for,other times u find what your looking for and can't order it,or like my last order,I thought I was ordering 1 of each except 1 item which I ordered 2 and got 2 of everything,when I looked at my review of my order it said 1 of each items except the one,when I went to relook it up when I got my order it would allow me to serve recent orders."
M C,09/02/2019,1,"Love them as a company, however, their choice to use Intelcom as a ‚Äúcourier service‚Äú has driven me away..... Amazon doesn't seem to care about customer service anymore and it's sad. When you request to have your packages shipped through ANY ONE ELSE, they tell you they can't do that because some of the things I might want are shipped in the areas where only Intelcom can pick them up. That's false. Amazon warehouses are in cities where other courier companies like Purolator and C. P. work as well"
Will Kaufman,17/02/2019,1,"App is useless. About 75% of the time it fails to display pages, returns errors, and just plain doesn't work. I frequently uninstall it so I can just use the mobile site, then re-install it because I need it for some stupid Amazon reason."
A Google user,17/02/2019,3,I love the variety and the different ways tl find things but I hate that the interesting finds almost never updates. Its Febuary almost March and I still have christmas theme on the app instead of Valentines day or Mardi Gras.
L Jay,18/02/2019,5,"I love AMAZON my Shopping experience and my streaming experience with PRIME video are immeasurably pleasing. No other product (NETFLIX, HULU, VUDU or any other such streaming experience) comes close to offering the shopping or video streaming vastness of media and material available and diversity and bottomline pricing that AMAZON does... AMAZON has AMA-ZING"
Father Of Jesus,01/02/2019,1,Amazon apps drain battery life too quick. Probably all that tracking they do. So I've cancelled my prime membership because I can't watch prime video on Android.
Amber Bodi,31/01/2019,1,Amazon lied to me! I was told I would receive a $10 credit. didn't receive. after talking to 2 different Amazon reps who told me they would credit me I still havent received it. liars. liars. cheats.
Sergio Fregoni,01/02/2019,1,"la peggiore esperienza di reso mai avuta con un ecommerce. semplicemente vergognoso. senza scuse. un mese per organizzare il pick up del reso senza emettere rimborsi, situazione mai risolta nonostante le promesse vuote del customer care. da cliente facevo pi√π di un ordine alla settimana, ora che ho provato il reso ho disinstallato l'app."

Robert Martin,31/01/2019,3,"What's gone wrong with the app, seems to default to U.S. for me and doesn't show my purchases, started after last update."
A Google user,07/02/2019,2,"The best way that Amazon works I's if you have the prime, if you do not have prime they are slow, they wait until the last moment to shipping ordered."
Alexandra Hill,14/02/2019,1,It was advised to me on thier site that if I downloaded it I'd receive 5 dollars. Now I can't find that money anywhere. The browser version works faster on my phone anyway. Will delete.

Gem O,16/02/2019,3,"I have noticed while using the app over the past few weeks it's become really unbearable especially when it comes down to tracking to see whether or not your package has been delivered. Recently when I check it says on the order list that its on its way but when I click on it it says its been delivered, which is it. Also many times I have been unable to follow the map as it always states that the driver is miles away when he isn't"
Rebecca Valderrama,20/02/2019,1,Customer service has really gone downhill and their guaranteed delivery dates mean nothing.
Matt Barn,10/02/2019,1,"incredibly slow and laggy UI, freezes or gets stuck on infinite loading screens constantly"
Shi,23/02/2019,3,the app never works right. and the customer service always says they fixes your problem and never does. then trick you into giving them good reviews. when the problem is still not solved.

Shad Redboy Sanders,06/02/2019,3,"Love the app, I used to not really like Amazon because I was so stuck on ebay but Amazon is definitely one of my favorite apps now, but this would be way better if your No Rush Reward balance can be applied to your total at check out because I don't use Prime Now for anything so I would be super excited and happy if I could use the No Rush Balance how I want to use it, I feel if you waited 6 days for No Rush then you should be able to use your rewards however you want, I'll give 5 stars if fixed"

David Henderson,11/02/2019,3,"With one of the recent updates, the app now shows ads (not stuff like ""what other customers purchased"", but actual, real ads.) Come on, guys! I'm already spending money on this app! Why did you need to throw in ads too?"

A Google user,15/02/2019,5,I cannot say enough good things about my Amazon shopping experience. I have been very pleased.
Emilia Baptiste,18/02/2019,1,Dont get prime. The worst experience ive had and ive been using amazon since they only offered books. They cant meet the deadlines they offer and use shady delivery companies like Dynamex which says they attempted delivery but didnt. Or says the package was delivered but its impossible because the place they delivered to was closed at the time. Then one rep promises one thing and another takes it back. Just not worth it.

nfghhd,,1,"Upon trying to log in via the app I was forced for some strange reason to change my password and conform the expiry date and an old debit card I no longer have. After a few failed attempts to guess the expiry date I was locked out of my account and amazon lost me as a customer. Quite hilarious, idiots."
Devon Will,,1,The app never manages to connect to the internet and forces me to use the website in the browser - useless
MRH781,,2,"It is very useful to read the reviews when assessing a product.  In the latest version, the link to the reviews no longer works and when you manually scroll down to them, they are incomplete and do not appear in a user friendly way like they used to."
grace_dd(),,2,"All i wanted was a phone case that would be next day delivery, but it was supposed to come thursday, but was moved to monday, still hasnt come yet ??"
Rich30,,2,I get it.  Amazon are not BFFs with apple. But please play nice and update your app to fit the screen on the new iPad Pro.
ratpoison,,2,"Gives an imminent delivery notification early in the day even though the driver wonít really arrive for hours. The number of deliveries before yours is unreliable, and that number and the map tend to disappear. 

Fix this and earn another star or two and also more business for amazon."
simi ireland,,1,"The user journey doesnít make sense, very complicated. And it often freezes saying error in network when you have perfect data and network coverage. Messaging center is so poor, you think you have sent a message and then a message pops up and says message error. Itís more glitchy than all the reselling apps Iíve used before."
Larry Darrell,,1,"Amazon Germany promised a 5-Euro coupon for downloading and signing into this app (yes I met the deadline).  I did as instructed, and the coupon never materialised.  App was immediately deleted."
Fudskie,,1,"Hi 
I updated this and now it opens as normal but when I tap the search bar it force closes - iOS 12.1.4"
bishboi23,,5,Sells poop
SeanDaw,,1,The map tracking feature which lets you know how far away has stopped working on the latest iOS version of the app (using iPhone X). Itís like it tries to pop up but then disappears like it crashes. Iíve scored it 1 star so that it gets noticed as I canít see any way of providing this sort of feedback through the app. It may be useful for Amazon to add an app feedback feature within the app itself to try and deal with similar problems.
Skoobaskunk,,2,"I do most of my shopping on Amazon and (try) to use this app on a weekly basis, but each release seems to break something new in the app.

The latest irritation is that the hyperlink to reviews for items appears to have been broken.

The developers really need to stabilise the app and introduce  some decent level of change control to avoid this one step forward, two steps back approach to release management."
Blacktaxitx2,,3,Have new iPad (2018 model) and cannot open any Amazon reviews. Have iPhone 8 and no problems. Both using same WiFi link. App is working ok besides this issue
Mr DLF,,2,"If there was another app I could use, Iíd use that one. I really donít like giving my money to the richest person in the world. 

The app is just too convenient.

Why canít I buy kindle books on the app?"
fortress55,,1,"Still unable to track the delivery of orders, received messages saying see where the driver is now but the map never shows and no updates.  Also the widget no longer works either.  Useless"
C-Tape,,1,Very missleading.
seventh discover,,1,"The app keep crashing down since last update, deleted and installed again 10 times, no luck though"
Veryannoyed!!,,2,This used to be great but now it is almost unusable. Half the time you type in a book name and you just get a page saying ëloadingí or a picture of a dog for some reason saying ësomething has gone wrongí. If you do actually get to the book you want and then want to look at the list of other books people have bought - again just a blank screen. Am going to Waterstones instead.
youngz85,,3,With the constant updates... You may as-well save memory on your phone and use the safari amazon web site.
BobPjunior,,3,The present version does not allow you to open the reviews from the initial page.
krr2000,,1,"Very hard return when barcode not working at post office, hard to contact online customers service or phone them, canít sort out problem"
JamesK1975,,2,Still no native support for the iPad Pro 11î in landscape mode.
IrritatedBrummy,,2,"Recent app updates have meant that, despite my delivery address being in the UK, search results show numerous items that cannot be shipped to mainland UK.

The search seems to be returning a combination of amazon marketplace sellers in the USA and ëfulfilled by amazoní items.

As a result, every other item is not delivered to mainland UK, causing frustration to me as a customer.

Furthermore, there is no way to default the app to only returning items that can be shipped to mainland UK, which makes for a poor user experience where the user has to waste time sourcing other sellers. Not exactly a one-stop solution."
Clive Sinclair,,1,Unable to view customer reviews on iPad version. Note.... iPhone version works fine. Worrying that such a simple bug can slip through both Amazon and Apples quality systems.
Bigspud,,1,"Oh dear, I use Prime an awful lot, since the recent update I canít buy anything, the basket page wonít respond, I canít proceed to the checkout, looks like Iím going to be saving an awful lot of money."
notreadbyhumans,,1,The checkout button doesn't work... A little more testing before clicking publish...
Old Man Pickle,,2,The app feels like a web wrapper and it doesnít even do that right. Product pages are always zoomed in so the edges are off screen without any way of fixing. Your better off using the website. Poor effort by Amazon considering all the updates they put out for this app.
mickeyeng92,,4,Would be even better with the resolution matching the iPad Pro 2018. Unprofessional how it is now with the black bars.
mikemars38,,1,"Still cannot open reviews on iPad app after latest update  , so useless app for me ??"
Czeshirecat,,2,"1. Links to reviews section have stopped working. I think several links to different sections of an advert are also failing.
2. Navigation is poor. Can go ëbackí, but thereís no ëforwardí and itís really annoying to have to re enter search terms and navigate through pages youíve been through before. 
3. Would like to be able to open pages in tabs like we can in a regular web browser."
Very angry ex customer,,1,Just wanted to confirm why Prime subscription had been reactivated without my knowledge. Very hard to find customer service or complaints on the app .
Sea77horses,,1,I am unable to look at peoples reviews on my new iPad Pro 10.5 is anybody else the same problem
Carlos90111,,1,Amazon I stole items and do not want to return or give me my money for the items that I stole and no one helps me customer service is a garbage do not buy here
Sandboxandsocks,,1,"I got the app due to the £5 off promo code, but I did not receive it, it said ìthe code has been added to your basketî. I go to checkout and no £5 off. I go back to the promo section, it says Iíve already redeemed the code but I havenít."
Alfie Stacey,,1,My brother order something it never arrived and I ordered something and it hasnít arrived today bloody hell get it together
hollylollymollyxoxo,,3,I guess its decent but not always that good tbh. Like I want to go to check out to buy my wish list and  thereís ALWAYS something wrong. it ALWAYS crashes are thereís and error?! I tried closing it as a tab and deleting and reinstalling the app and itís the same. What shall I do?!
markkellett,,1,I donít no what they have changed on this app from before because itís all over the place I used to open it and see what Iíve been looking at now I have to scroll down and down to find it
Philbeast,,1,I bought a charging port on amazon with ìsame day deliveryî and itís been way more than 24 hours. Although iíve been refunded it took many attempts to find someone helpful when i called in multiple times. This company isnít worth anyoneís money or anyoneís time as far as iím concerned...
Bladerunner5298,,2,"I like to use Amazon Smile so my chosen charity gets a bit of money but it is not available on the app, disappointing ??"
Archieisxxgemmakellylovehim,,1,Iím extremely disappointed that amazon donít actually sell 6ft lava lamps me and a friend really wanted one and was very upset to see that they donít in fact sell them! Please sort this Injustice out amazon.
Svenson32,,2,Trying to find wish lists in the app and keep getting a message saying need to update. Then go to update only to find I have the latest version and there are no updates. A bit frustrating for an otherwise good app
kizersoze,,1,Controllers jump around a lot. Not sure why
AlexisEld,,1,"Dear amazon , my mum had ordered me earpods FOR my birthday. So now itís not really a present if my birthday has gone by..... AMAZON NEEDS TO UPPP THHHEEEIIIRRRRRR GGAAAAMMMMMMEEEEEEEEE"
ClichË,,1,crashes upon opening
oversby12,,1,"Iím not locked out of my account and the 2 step verification wonít work now

Pagemakers,,2,"I wanted to contact customer services. 

Was so easy before. Iíd just send an email. 

Now I have the irritating messaging ëassistantí and I just go round and round in circles with it. I donít want online chat and I donít want you to call me. I donít have the time. I want to email customer services but the system wonít let me.

UPDATE Feb 2019: The review link no longer works on an iPad running iOS 12.1.3. Tried on numerous devices."
kdavisa,,4,"Generally, I've found this addon to be handy, though as far as I can see, some features I find useful in Amazon in a browser are missing - the ability to view and improve my Recommendations, for example, and reduce the number of times I get pestered to buy my latest purchase!
Another restriction - added in an update, I assume, is that isn't possible to view reviews, part of the previous handiness!"
ShaneZZ,,1,"Come on, hurry up and update for the new 11î iPad, should have been done way before now (Feb 19). Black bars are not cool."
Fugwunkle sploffypants,,1,"The app is rubbish because it wonít allow you to sign out of one account to use another. 

That makes it pretty useless."
Clivuss,,2,"Title says it all.  The app has recently become a visual disaster, full of unwanted pictures of totally unrelated and uninteresting products to whatever you may have searched for in the past (if ever at all).  Iíve noticed that Product searches can be almost amusing (if they werenít so flaming irritating) - when you see the wildly inaccurate results that turn up, in as much that they are often completely unrelated to even the most simplistic of search words or terms that youíve entered.  

Unfortunately, the Desktop site isnít much better these days and appears to be following the same trend. - Somethingís going terribly wrong Amazon - please sort it out!"
Cader10,,1,"This app used to be very good however since the the recent update (Jan 19) i have had nothing but trouble. on several occasions it  can be unresponsive on a few occasions it has just keeps crashing. I also find when choosing different parts of the menu, it is very slow to respond. Common Amazon get your act together and sort it."
Togga88,,1,Doesnít work only gives message ìno internet connectionî reinstalled 3 times and still doesnít work.

D-Silver,,1,Worthless piece of trash application literally refuses to scan my credit card.
amgdude,,2,"If you want something next thatís great but most products are cheaper elsewhere also more and more items Iíve ordered are being delivered wrong or inferior quality. The returns process on broken items is terrible.

Just imagine how much more money you could make if you could find what youíre looking for."
Samso kid,,5,Does all the basic functions of making a purchase on Amazon and does it very well. What more can one ask from an App?
Erfattone,,1,Bad policies.TAKES THEM MONTHS TO REFUND AN ITEM YOU RETURN. RETURN PROCESs IS A JOKE. I get better customer service on alibaba. Joke of a company
Me0011,,3,"1. You never know the country where you are buying the item from. 
2. If you place and order it doesnt take the money straight away then tells you next day or so payment bounced. 
I think theres are Amazon problems and not just this app."
A5wii,,2,Please can you fix the landscape display so its full screen on the new Ipad Pro 11 please ? Then I will be happy ??
Timfrombattle,,3,"Iíve been using this for years. Over time more and more ìfeaturesî are added which I have no interest in and things stop working. Currently the basket icon no longer shows me the number of items in it. Not a show stopper but irritating. The app often spends a few minutes spinning its wheel when I try to do something simple like open an item in a search list. Talking of searching, I would like the search to give me an option of sorting by relevance AND another criteria, such as price. Instead, if I sort by price, I have to wade through loads of items that are irrelevant. Iíd like to be able to specify a price range Iím willing to pay. This isnít possible and yet itís so basic. Iím not really the sort of client Amazon wants. I donít want recommendations or Alexa. I just want to be able to find the things I want and buy them. How hard can it be?"
Lady Pen P,,1,It tells me to update : I have updated it! So I cannot get onto someone elseís gift list!
Sandija Davis the YouTuber,,5,I love this app but I think you should add a description so if the person doesnít know what the thing is called then they can just describe what they want instead of spending forever trying to find out what itís called or they just give up. Other then that I canít see any negatives.

Enigma Music,,1,"Although, I had been enjoying shopping on Amazon since 2004 but since I became a Prime Member in 2014 then I started been using it extensively by spending £1.5K at least every month including household things etc.

But unfortunately, from past few days, it has started working like a cripple horse. The app takes too much time to search, open item, or even to place an order takes ages.

I am shocked after knowing that such a reputable company is outsourcing its programming code from India where the students pass their so-called I.T. degrees from IIT by cheating in exams due to which such third class programmers donít know anything else except copy/paste. These programmers have studied all their lives through rot learning which makes them just like parrots who donít know the meaning of words but yet it entertains to its owner by speaking in cute voice.

I will strongly urge Amazonís American authorities to give a big dandda in the tuiz of these masala programmers so that they stop ruining the shipping experience of the genuine customs who generate billions of profits for Amazon."

Kimia__,,3,"This app has all the essential requirements of amazon which is great. But, lately my student prime has been suspended for absolutely no reason??

Anon4578976554478,,2,"When I search for specific items on the desktop site I can almost always find what Iím looking for but when I try to do so on the app I have found far fewer items available for viewing - sometimes only two or three out of hundreds that can be found in the website. I am giving two stars because the app is functional, just not very user friendly. The way the tabs work is needlessly annoying in that tabs pile up and there is no way to go back other than backtrack no through them all which can be tedious or skipping right back to the home page and losing all the tabs. In the end itís easier to just use the website in chrome or safari than use this mess of an app."
Jekecha,,1,Just use the website I donít recommend you use the app you can do so much more on the website than the app.

chowie123,,3,"Decent app but missing a few things that have already been mentioned by other reviewers. Another feature I would personally add that hasnít been mentioned is the ability to lock an orders details to a specific device. Everyone in my household uses the same prime account but this means we all have the same account logged on in all our devices, which means we can all see the order history which means that ordering Birthday/Xmas presents is a lot less private than I would like it to be. Fix this and it is 5 stars from me."

Numb15,,3,"The app is responsive and intuitive.
You can also call or chat to someone from customer services within the app. That is where the problem is: the customer service location seems to be based in India, which isnít known for its friendly or customer-service oriented mindset. Iíve come across some agents who are a bit stubborn or unhelpful."
JPOR,,4,Nice app as always. Been using this for the past 4 years. 4 stars because Iím disappointed that this update still doesnít give a full screen experience on my new iPad Pro 2018 11 inch. A few apps are now doing this like IMDB for example. So not sure on why the slow update as the new iPad has been around now for nearly 4 months.as soon as this is done then happy to give 5 stars.

Elmobaggins,,1,"Why am I forced to use this horrible app when it just doesnít work as well as the website? It doesnít have all the useful features like being able to filter by a certain department, etc. You just canít find the things you want and get stuck in a loop looking for them. Iím put off shopping at Amazon now because every time I click on an Amazon link it takes me out of safari and to this app - which, by the way, I HATE! Let people choose whether to use the app or not. If nobody uses it, then you know itís rubbish!"
DarrenClubland,,1,Useless app you update the app to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience really I came off this pathetic excuse you call an app not buying anything due to the fact everything I clicked on came up with still loading utter rubbish lost me to Ebay one of the reasons I donít really bother with Amazon anymore is due to the fact you canít provide a decent bug free Application to use Amazons loss not mine doesnít even deserve the 1 star I can see why itís rated bad
rosieglow76,,2,The app is fine if you want to purchase physical items but canít seem to purchase digital items and browser seems to redirect to app all the time so have ended up having to delete it. Had this issue some time ago and have just recently reinstalled it as assumed it would have been sorted by now but sadly not.  For a company with so much digital content canít believe they canít  get this right .
JocsJay,,1,"Awful app, accounts on hold for false reasons, when I rang customer services, they couldnít see what was wrong because itís on hold, how is this app/website so backwards. Received little to no help, only positive was that customer services were polite but they didnít know what to do either. Unhold my account, thereís no way of emailing the official amazon email, no actual real person responds to me through ëamazon specialistí is a repeated email copied and pasted. This is so inconvenient."

lb2032,,1,"App needs to be able to open burger side menu/go back a page by dragging right on any part of the screen, consistent with many iOS apps. At the moment, this is only possible if you drag from the very edge of the left hand side of the screen. Not easy with larger devices."
Rally1642,,1,"The app works for purchases but the returns process is worse than useless.

So you find the order in the app press print the label and it takes you back the website and yes you guessed it  ìnow enable cookiesî ìnow enable cookiesî ìnow enable cookiesî Typical Amazon we had your money now try and contact us if you can!!!!"
scribe wizard,,1,Great app other than if scrolling through your saved basket items. Every five or so items and you a forced to look at recently viewed items. This makes scrolling impossible.  So annoying!!!!!
ELastic_Refrigerator,,2,"I opened the app on iPhone and iPad. Pressed Home on both. The iPhone version is rich with plenty of information about what I might like and what I have bought before. 

The iPad app is completely different. 
Itís like it was built for a different person. I have never viewed marble run games before and never bought jewelry or knitting books. That is all that is on the iPad screen. Itís like itís a different database or something. 
You also canít buy kindle books on it; itís still a purchase, I donít understand why? If I canít do it though, at least tell me, donít just remove the buy button!

Get it on your phone. Go to the website on your iPad."

No matter how many times I double tapped the deliver to address button, it will not do anything. Not a very good future if youíre trying to use the app to buy things. Hope you can fix it soon as itís really annoying and bugging me! I am a totally blind user of your app and on the whole Iíve generally found it very accessible but this is a major floor.

timetogetrealanazon2018,,1,"Too many sponsored or suggested items. There should at the least be an option to turn them off. 
Also, when is the last time you went into a shop, and they charged you different amounts for different sizes of the same item?"
johnnydocnumberone,,1,"Since the update there is a problem with the wish list in regards to kindle books. When I select a title on my wish list the next page, usually showing synopsis, reviews, buying options etc, no longer loads and there is a blank page. Additionally, if I search for a kindle title and select it, the same thing happens so that I canít even add it to my wish list. This problem does not happen with the iPhone app and I can add titles from there. This renders the iPad app useless. 

I have emailed Amazon with this problem and I received a response telling me I cannot purchase from my device which utterly misses the point. I donít want to purchase the book on this iPad I want to research it, read reviews etc and this is easier to do on the iPad as opposed to the iPhone and kindle, for obvious reasons. Subsequently, I was advised to call and spoke to 3 people, none of whom could understand what I was talking about, and began to seriously doubt that had ever come into contact with the app. 

I see that some people have experienced similar issues and it strikes me as farcical that the company has not identified this yet and responded appropriately with a new update. It takes a supreme level of incompetence to render a decent app virtually useless and remain utterly ignorant of the issue."
Robert67432,,3,Overall a good usable app but random virtual dash buttons keep appearing. This is a little annoying
zhijunshan,,4,... everything in this App need pay......
HiFi Anorak,,1,Every time you search for something you get ëpromotedí results only. You have to select customer ratings for every search. It feels like they are just pushing the highest paying advertisers and hiding the actual customer favourites. Thoroughly annoying and worryingly coercive.
Antarctica71,,2,I am unable to request an A to Z refund because there is no option to report a problem with an order on the orders page in the app. I will have to wait to do it on my laptop. Safari and Chrome on my iPhone 7 Plus will not show the orders in the full website version either. Unhelpful.
Player Bg,,1,very very not goooood still waiting from my buying 3days... only take my money.
JHCain,,1,"The app regularly fails to load screens, rendering it useless."
Bluemoonrisen,,2,"Will not work over mobile data since latest update, app only works via WiFi connection"
MammaPo,,2,"The app itself makes it fairly easy to search for books & products, and manage oneís orders. But the relentless ads (for unsolicited books that I have no interest in) are incredibly irritating and make me lose interest in shopping on Amazon."
cjf dorset,,1,"As others have said, used to be a good app. Fed up of recommendations andî based on browsing historyî having no relevance to anything I have looked at or bought.
Stop putting up the cheap Chinese stuff, thatís what Wish is for!"
suzi two,,3,Why do you show a photo of an object and when I click on it I canít find it
trekkie_ram,,1,"Iím delighted that Facebook wants to advertise amazon... but when I click on the thing that tempts me, Iím taken to this app instead of the page.

Sure, thatís a fault with Facebook, but if this amazon app wasnít so useless that I needed to delete it, I wouldnít have an issue.

Please just remove your poor app from existence."
Spursman61,,1,This is a con to get you to install the app as there is no promo code showing. The sad thing about this is that an Amazon seller will now miss out on my order as I will now go elsewhere.
LydGol,,4,This is generally a very good app and I use it all the time to buy things worth one click. However I have found that the order tracking can be quite misleading at times. For example right now on my account if I select ëmy ordersí in the list it shows I have an order ëArriving todayí. However when I click that order and navigate to the next screen it says ëArriving tomorrow by 9pmí. This leads to some disappointment.
Nifnn,,1,"Downloaded the app, followed the instructions, clicked the banner (which took a while to find!) and was told Iíd successfully redeemed the coupon. When I tried to buy a qualifying item the promo code wasnít applied. What a con."
Dafjkbycsv2000,,1,I have downloaded the app before. Stop putting ads on the mail online app which are just too easy to accidentally click on. Itís so annoying.
Sonyaoliver,,2,"This version will not allow me to look up someoneís wish list and asks me to update but this is the latest version of the app and will not update. So frustrating, especially before Christmas"
Wintboy,,4,"Good app if you know what youíre looking for but, your suggestions are way off. You suggest items such as dog baskets - Iíve never had a dog. 
Cat toys - Iíve never had a cat.
Baby cots and car seats - my youngest is 33 years.
Car maintenance tools - I tried that 40 years ago but not since.

Please put sensible suggestions out there!"
gnnjs,,1,When trying to get audible app to work with it it doesnít absolute pain
Dnejdjc,,1,The latest update needs updating as when scrolling for an item if you go into that item for more detail. When you come back out it takes you back to the top again. Itís so frustrating you end up loosing interest and looking elsewhere.
Bern2T,,3,"This doesnít work the same way as Add items did. Please donít keep this. You gave us items back and now itís back to ideas, which you canít edit or customise like items. PLEASE GIVE BACK ëADD ITEMSí ??"
BigBirdGrim,,2,"Not really sure why itís been designed to make it so hard to see family members ëWish Listísí. In my mind it would make sense to add the option to add friends to your circle to easily view lists. This would make it far easier to buy xmas presents, and I would assume help to increase sales...?"
Gatekeeper101,,5,I have never had an issue with this app. Opens quickly and is easy to navigate as well as a simply ordering system. Does exactly what you would expect. Recommended
shangomam09052001,,2,"Use to be faultless, now very slow loading and occasional glitches, starting to become very frustrating to use, have even started purchasing elsewhere because of these issues."
Qlikesit,,4,"Garbage APP, need to pay for every items in it."
Unimpressedtwo,,1,"I have just downloaded this App to purchase books but it won't let me! I select kindle from the item page and it goes to a new page where you can sample and two formats or add to a list but you cant buy and download?
My wife has an older version of the app which works seamlessly. Very dissapointed!"
Lee and Lucy,,5,I am a person who wald want to shop all year
proux,,2,"Amazon supports charities if you order through the website, but not through the app. How can this NOT be possible? Please can you add it at last"
another silly boy,,5,"So easy to use and I can buy things in minutes.
I look for items that are free post.
Because postage can double the price.
I go to checkout to see what the post is.
Then I can cancel or buy.
Yes I love the app 
5 stars from me"
Shop for clothes,,1,Not ordering my orders and just saying ìpayment revision neededî
Leosmad,,2,"I looked to contact to say thereís a bug. 
Youíve made the app for the iPhone XS XR, the thing is thatís all it now fits? The larger screen size that is. You canít ìbuy nowî or see the bottom couple of items as that part of the screen is now missing and additionally covered by an annoying pop up saved bar? For all but the X series of phones. No good for the 8-7-6 etc
Please get this sorted, itís really annoying"
StuDerBux,,1,Please fix it
Matt_EA,,3,"The entire app now seems to be optimised for the larger screen of ëXí generation iPhones, so bits of the interface appear off the bottom of the screen on iPhone 8 and earlier, and canít be selected or viewed. Major flaw!"
aftertouch,,1,Never works once I get to ordering - always crashes when changing payment or shipping options. Will delete app as a result :-(
ibrahim23675,,1,Blood of Jesus this app is slow. Didnít make it to checkout after 10 mins of waiting at a loading screen.
nczm86,,3,"I have iPhone 8 bought just before the release of X and when using the app the bottom of the screen is cut off.
This needs fixing..."
Bunjamin,,1,I can no longer see options as theyíre hidden at the bottom of the app now.  Presume itís now optimised for bigger screen phones but it doesnít work on mine.
BEVSTER1965,,3,This app is dangerous! There should be a limit set on ëbuy with one clickí accidentally hit this button and purchased a Gucci watch for £638.00!!!! Needs to be a prompt like ëare you sure?í!!!
nicknamewhatwhat,,2,Canít access buttons on options such as customer service chat and other options any more. CS Chat also donít forget what last subject and wonít go back to start so you can discuss another problem.
Gre99m,,3,Things appear off the bottom of the screen iPhone 6s like one click by now. Options for sizes when menu opens. The chat on customer support. We donít all pave iPhone X
CynanX,,3,The app was alright however the later version no longer support the older screen sizes so Iím now unable to do certain things :(
Zarn Smith,,2,Tried to search for stuff via the app and get a something went wrong message. The website works fine.
Chunderheed,,2,If you donít have the new iPhone the app is difficult to use as most of the screens donít fit on the iPhone 7 / 6 and are cut off at the bottom. Hopefully Amazon will appreciate that not all their customers will have the latest model phone and put out a fix for this soon.
townyfc,,1,Had this app and wonít connect to internet had to delete and reinstall it still donít work
SlackAlice54321,,1,"There is nowhere to contact Amazon with queries. Order didnít arrive when stated, and so far spent all day in waiting for order today. Tracking information says it will b with me by 9pm. Whole day wasted waiting for delivery plus all day yesterday wasted. Surely u can estimate within a couple of hours when delivery will turn up. ??
NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER."
gashe86,,1,instead of improving the application is getting worse
Amberflame,,1,Amazon say I need to update app to get all wish list functionality but there is no update in App Store ??
Dacs42,,1,"The app has broken somehow: the size options when you want to buy anything do not show up, as if the app is made for a bigger screen and doesnít reduce in size. It used to work but a recent update must have broken it"
Mimimi555,,5,Amazon is super it it always correct and when it isnít you can always tell someone
Fruity on the inside,,1,Latest update has ruin my viewing of items. Cuts off the bottom of the screen. I have an iPhone 7. Looks like app has been designed for the larger phone.
Lee vallis,,2,"Very disappointed with sound quality! Loud enough but no depth to sound, would need to add a sub!!!! Considering the size of these speakers there pretty poor really??."
Musical Joe,,3,Amazon should really be able to support older devices - the chat support experience is horrible on iPhone 6
nat pullen,,1,"I physically cannot add anything to my basket. Iíve tried resetting my phone and made sure Iíve got the latest version of the app, but nothing works. I tap the add to basket button and nothing happens! So I thought Iíd go on my browser on my phone to do it, but it just auto redirects me to the app! What an absolute waste of time. Iím having to remember everything I want and then ordering it on my computer when I get home. Sort it out"
Trust meh,,2,"When viewing the basket, I cant change the delivery details without getting stuck with a blue spinning wheel... changing the delivery address or the postage type is impossible.
App needs an update"
nna772,,1,"Useless app that has obviously been set up for a bigger screen. I have an iPhone 6 and all of the edges of the app are missing, meaning I cannot use the app. Particularly apparent when trying to contact customer services to complain as the button to continue is off the bottom of the screen."
AthanSim,,5,"I am writing this review in order to report a bug with the current version of the app and iPhone 8 Plus screen size.  
It looks that the app thinks that the iPhone 8 Plus has longer screen (like iPhone XR) as part of information is not displayed at full at the bottom of the screen. 
Otherwise the app works great."
Leveas10188,,2,its a 17+ app but Prime Video is 12+???
cmaburns,,4,Good app but it would be good to be able kindle books from within the app.
_Lel_,,3,"All fine but sometimes canít go back to previous item, and then on 3 occasions, always when I have tried to order something to a new address, the app has gone all the way through agreeing it will send the order to the new address, and then on the confirmation page shows the order with the default delivery address. I then have to cancel and re-order via computer. Very annoying."
Wankers 1,,1,100% useless no customer service absolute Garbage service
o.42,,1,"Amazon close my account with no reason, ìyour email address doesnít exist in our system ì and just contact customer service the lady keep me 24 min on the phone and in the end: she said: for security reasons we are not able to recover your account. Iím sorry- there no options to prove/recognise that you are the account holder 

Well done guys!!"
kazzaLondon,,2,Now canít use amazon assistant as cant scroll down to select yes Iím contacting you about this product !  Something wrong with screen size on app ????
budmanuk,,1,The app is cutting the bottom off some screens on my iPhone 7 +. How much bigger screen do i need?
fastcars_sloegin,,1,App is not scaled properly for iPhone 8 or earlier. The bottom of the page is cutoff and I cannot contact customer services in the app.
Nocturnal white collar worker,,1,Update means you canít see the ìcomplete orderî button ?!
Rylston,,1,"Somethingís gone really wrong, the app doesnít fit the screen anyone.
The swipe bar to pay is cut off at the bottom of the screen, sometimes I canít checkout. Surely they are losing a lot of revenue from this, youíd have thought this would have been fixed, but been like this all week"
Hoodwinked5,,2,"App functions as well as any other I guess, notifications quite useful for deliveries: would give a 4 star review, however a recent update means that various aspects appear below the bottom of the screen. For example buy now slider only visible a couple of mm rather than full button. But also happens in numerous other places. I have an SE but this seems to have been reported on various other form factor iPhones."
Tractorboy964,,1,Worked passably but now ìStill Loading...î. All screens fail to load. Deleted app. Rebooted iPhone SE. Downloaded app again. Same issue. App support link on AppStore doesnít work either. Classic!
cure_liqueur,,2,"I still use this app BUT, since a recent update, there are so many bugs, especially not being able to see product options as they display 'off screen' at the bottom of my iPhone 7. 

The app has always been a bit glitchy in general. Areas that haven't had enough attention paid to them.

Please create a nicely refreshed app that works for your customers. You've got plenty of them!!!"
GNagra101,,1,"Be very careful, many of the product reviews arenít actually related to the item. Almost like someone has copied and pasted good reviews from other products to make the product look better then what it is."
Claire2k4,,1,"I have used the app constantly on the iPhone 6s without any probs. New iPhone XR and so buggy its painful! Sorry Amazon, this needs to be better."
gmcq1,,1,Be aware that switching on notifications for deliveries also switches on marketing notifications which cannot subsequently be removed.
Very hard to write a review,,1,"Amazons postal service is not fit to purpose do not use them go to a proper company 
They are rip of merchants i am currently in the process of having them prosecuted by trading standards they are out to rip you off to make you pay excessive postage services. Go elsewhere cheaper and faster"
Heart in Rannoch,,5,"Giving one star to see if I can instigate a conversation with the development team. 

I have noticed that going to customer service contact us section in the app brings up a chat. The issue is that the bottom of the screen is cut off so you cannot respond to it. Seems to be a flaw in how the app perceives the screen size. Checked App Store and tried the support option, but this is only a how to section, with no option to give feedback."
BigPinkers,,1,The automated customer service screen comes up but wonít let you scroll down far enough to write anything?
Rodarse,,3,"Have an Iphone 7 Plus and I am finding recently that all the information at the bottom of the page is cut off and you canít scroll up. This is so irritating when there is either a choice on the product or to swipe to order :(

Please could there be an update to fix this"
sky singh,,1,Last update customer service send a message canít come out of message below send message to seller or not now canít have to move page up I can see it but you canít press it
olsiris,,4,"A recent update to this app has caused it to cut off the bottom of the display on my iPhone 7. It looks like itís been optimised for newer (taller) screens. This is particularly noticeable when selecting sizes of products and you canít see the price, or using the ëBuy Nowí button which then cuts off the ëswipe to buyí button. 

Unfortunately I couldnít find how to give app feedback, hence leaving this review."
Gracelogin,,1,I wonít be subscribe and saving because it is not possible to update my payment details on the app. Amazonís loss.
pokeplayer YT,,5,The beat
Psycator,,1,Not obvious how to log out of the app and log in with a different account. Resorted to uninstalling the app. Waste of time.
tick tock croc,,5,Very good but can it be English
Barmy33,,3,"App ok, I seem to spend a lot of money on it if thatís a measure of success, but.....developers 

Please increase text font size, or make it compatible with iPads ability to increase font size, or give me an in app option to increase font size, its getting harder and harder to read item descriptions, without having to zoom in and then I have to scroll around the page which is beginning to grate."
shoppingelsewherenow,,1,So I clicked on the shop now and it brought me to this from Facebook! So wonít be shopping then.
Stamford the Lion,,2,"I have an iPhone 6plus and when using the app and selecting certain options for items, the screen doesnít fit fully on my screen. The bottom of the page is missing. Makes it almost impossible to to add to basket or whatever other option is down there. 
Need sorting"
Verrrrrrrrrra,,1,They log me out of my account and logged in to other one. And guess what.. there is no Log out bottom!!!
emojo ????????????,,5,I think this app is great for buying the write stuff you need for a great price and well done to whoever made this app because I am great full u did
Scambo1223,,1,Since last update when browsing items there is much cropping of the UI. Sometimes I cannot select things at the bottom of the screen. Currently on iphone 6s latest software. Please fix b
micks1979,,4,"Have had no issues using this app. LOVE IT. The only thing I would change is when the item gets dispatched where is said, tell us where to leave it the only thing I would change is given us a option where it says Other, so we can Type it, As some of the options are not what I want to say or where to leave it so giving us an option so we can specify where to leave it."
sp-manager,,1,"Since the Amazon app update I am unable to shop on amazon. When there are different choices within an item, for instance size/colour and you select the box to change this they usually come up along the bottom enabling you to scroll across to select your choice which also gives price of each selection. Now they come up along the bottom but you can only see the top quarter of the selections so you barely see the choices and canít see price, I try to scroll down to view but it just pops back to where it was which stops you from making any selections. This new update was supposed to fix bugs but it seems to have created them!! Not happy"
Splotsmum,,2,Use this all the time and decided to update all my apps recently including this. Went to buy something today and found that when I do ìbuy it nowî itís been optimised for a larger screen so I canít actually use the slider on the buy it now pop up screen. Utterly stupid. Ruined a perfectly good app. Well done
Cherrypie2609,,3,"Bug fix please. Once you press 1-click ordering, the pop up screen to confirm order, half hides the confirmation slider button."
Angeypants,,2,Noticed that the price info doesnít fit on the screen when I look at an item which comes with different options.
Ambmol,,2,Screens now donít fit to size of handset - example is customer support screen - option buttons are off the screen and cannot be accessed. Needs to be fixed.
Kmulz,,1,Itís not possible to send a message on chat as the typing space runs off the screen. Can you fix please. Iíve already sent an email but had no reply
Grumps147,,1,"Looks like latest bug fix release was just that, it inserted a bug that means you cannot order. App is useless until that is fixed."
StronsayOrkney,,1,"So I am offered free delivery, because I fulfil all the criteria.  I know that Amazon then try to con you into standard delivery and then apply a delivery charge. The app does not allow modifications to standard delivery. The solution is to login using the web browser, where I can the choose free delivery. This makes the app pointless!"
Woggyboy,,1,I would like a strait forward transaction by seeing the price and paying if itís reasonably priced. Not prime!
bastarts,,1,Wonít process the payment on Free Standard Delivery.
Raymaker8,,1,"The swipe right to purchase bar is covered by the home line on the iPhone X so you cannot purchase anything, do you guys test anything or are you too busy being agile and changing the app all the time! Please be agile and move it up about 10mm so I can buy things again !"
StephyM,,1,"This app was brilliant and my go-to place for looking up products with mega easy swipe to order. However recently the app cuts off the bottom part of items that have multiple options which is usually the price - very unhelpful. I just tried to order something and the swipe option was cut off at the bottom of the screen so I couldnít access it. Not great right before Black Friday Amazon, pleeeease fix it!"
Breezyuk,,1,"Ok, Let me just say this:This IS NOT about the app
and I donít wanna go to court.This is a joke.
Okay ENOUGH OF THESE
DISCLAMERSSS
Anyway, so for my homework I wanted to do a snow globe that had the solar system of PLANETS in it with gold glitter and violet water
Keep in mind I bought the planets on AMAZON and they were PRIME

That was 5 days before I wrote this

??Iím angery"
nikolnikolnikol,,1,"The thing that I ordered didnít work, when I tried to contact the seller they asked me to wait. I was waiting but nothing happened. Then I wanted to claim but Amazon was deleted my order. So I lost my money and canít do nothing."
frk07,,1,The bottom is now being cut off for some reason . I cant reach the typing bar during live chat . Fix it please .
Basiumis,,1,"Since theyíve elongated the app for iphonex I can no longer see prices on other options or use the help assistant. This is awful thinking by the developers, at least keep it working for those of us that have a phone older than a year old.
Iím an amazon prime subscriber and Iím thinking of stopping because whatís the point if I canít use the app properly?!?"
Strukef,,4,The slide button when buying something is almost whole hidden
sarahlooby_lou,,2,"For the last couple of weeks when selecting a different option for a product, the whole option doesnít display so prices are not visible and itís tricky to actually select the required icon. Happens with the one rap buying too: the ëSwipe to buyí only has a tiny bit visible so itís quite tricky to do. If I was a new user Iíd have no idea how to use it.
Needs fixing!!"
a.pack,,1,"Very poor app, have many glitches and became difficult to use. The recommendations are useless."
Joe7556,,1,"Rubbish, unable to work on an iPad     Was sent a link for something to look at and it instantly opens the app on a prime page without the ability to look for the item Iíd been advised about"
Tina_Arena101,,1,Not sure whatís happened to the app but for some reason now the app is cutting off the bottom so you can no longer see details of buy it now delivery stuff. Can only just about slide to purchase... Iím on an iPhone 6S.
Polly ??,,5,I see a lot of bad feedback about the app. But so far it works good for me. I was even able to have someone call me right away from Customer Care via chat in ìCustomer Serviceî earlier.
Mattin0,,3,"The app keeps saying 'Uh-oh, something went wrong'.

When I try to swipe to purchase, I end up swiping out of the app completely (iPhone XS Max). The swipe is too low on the screen."
Privas65,,2,"This was a great app, sadly it is less reliable. Any ëbug fixesí in an update seem to bring more bugs with it. 
My most recent bug is the fact I seem to have some items that I have ordered that appear to say ëArriving today, on its wayí but when I click on it to see tracking information its actually ëArriving tomorrowí. Sort it out!"
Strausswaltz,,1,"The latest incarnation of this app purports to show items related to stuff Iíve looked at - NO,  Today itís glasses.  I have enough glasses to stock a shop!

It then goes on to show other stuff, I might be interested in, again NO.  Please stop tinkering and leave it as it was in the early days, very easy to use etc."
Sensible Sam,,1,"As above title.

Sort it out please and update wishlist prices so they are current and accurate!

I mean, these are minimum requirements for any shopping App, let alone the biggest e-commerce retailer on the planet!!!"
Fat man Sam,,1,"It has recently become impossible for me to make purchases through the app. The delivery address that is automatically selected is wrong, and when I click on the correct address the app freezes and then eventually crashes"

mmmmmmmaarrrrrkkkkk,,1,"Amazon app stopped working and is no use, waste of time have the iPhone X and it stopped working a few days ago.

karenlucia,,1,USELESS. Iím moved to Spain none of them find me. DHL does. Given up.
philbickley,,3,A lot of the options are cut off on iPhone 7. Clicking on a style on an item brings up a selection tray but itís only about 50% visible
JTD96,,1,The new update makes the app IMPOSSIBLE to speak to customer service - itís ridiculous because most of my purchasing is on the phone. I canít raise an issue or follow up on an order at all. Fix this stupid glitch.
kiaula,,3,Iphone 8 plus Sliding bar is hiding cant finish the purchase. I have to buy everything through basket
717x,,2,"It seems I am not the only one to experience odd things popping up not relating to my purchases etc. There seems no way of rectifying this. I feel as if Iím looking into somebody elseís life! I have tried everything - contacted customer services three times and when they did deign to reply, I was told a load of rubbish. I will probably give up on the app now"
sinistersword,,1,From GMB Unionís Twitter: ìAmazon are treating their workers like robots. Over the last three years 600 ambulances have been called to their UK warehouses and 115 have been sent to their Rugeley site alone.î
NatJR_*,,1,"Since the update a couple of days ago, (iPhone 6s) the swipe bar to purchase as a Buy it now is two thirds off of the bottom of the screen. Sometimes you can just manage to touch it to enable swipe. Other times you need to add to basket and complete purchase from there. Really slowing down quick purchases. Please can this be rectified in the next update."
Roryadgyt,,5,Love it
carlieb1989,,1,"Since the update I cannot type to customer service on my iPhone 7+

ji1337,,1,"A simple task to change delivery option does not work. They want me to pay extra £3.99 for delivery! No thanks, eBay is cheaper."

RyanHP,,4,"If you receive an email with a link to print a return label and you click it using an ipad/iphone, it will load up the Amazon app and take you to the label to print - thatís great, except there is no button to print the label, because we are in the app and not in Safari, so canít access the Print feature like we used to - please fix.
Another small bug, when you are in the app on iPad, if you click add to basket, a narrow black dialog briefly appears to say ëAdded to basketí or something similar and then disappears - the formatting is wrong and it is right aligned, with a big space on the left. I am using iPad Air, landscape, iOS 12.1
One more I remembered - I recently went to purchase a product that had an ëofferí I had accepted/voucher I clicked on to enable, to save £3 for some reason. The app took me through to the payment screen and preselected my credit card and the use gift balance enabled - I didnít want to use my gift balance so changed the payment to credit card - when I returned to the previous screen, the free offer credit was removed from the calculation; the only way to keep it was to either leave the initial payment method or carry out the purchase in a browser, which I did.
The rest of the app seems to work very well for me; I love the notifications of when my item will arrive, although, it always initially says my delivery is only 8 stops away, and then I click for the detail and it consistantly shows me a zoomed in map that shows the deliverer location about two roads away, at the same spot, every time, the info then later jumps to say only 2 stops away - the info flow seems rather hit or miss, itís as if youíve placed an arbitrary point on the map to make it look like they are closeby when you donít actually know where the delivery is, so I donít trust it anymore. It only seems to become accurate at the last moment, I think there is a bug there or you just donít receive  enough updates from the deliverer terminals for some reason."
Emm4J,,5,Love the app itís great. Would be good if Amazon created a function where if you have already received an item you can select an option to say delivered.
GameplayByNecro,,4,"The app is absolutely fantastic and I use it all the time. However, 1 small problem is that there is no simple way to view all of your Lists at once, only your Wish List. This is very inconvenient as I use multiple lists on a regular basis. Just adding a button for ""Lists"" would be great and earn the final star."

Fermi LaPorta,,1,"Whisper it quietly, but amazon deliveries are now often very slow (and not just if you select free shipping) and prices are often not competitive. OFTEN. 

As for the app itself, as other users have noted it lists random stuff as your recommendations, ërelated to items you have viewedí etc. When things you can see are this wrong you ask yourself what is going wrong that you canít see."
Etairpete,,2,The ëadd to wishlistí shortcut worked in safari and if the wishlist page itself didnít keep freezing and if I could search for something without being automatically redirected to amazon echo. Sort it out!
Steve bluntie,,1,"Amazon is great for almost everything and the app is amazing my convienient... if you can use it. Why the heck is it rated 17+, This Is not only pointless as the worst thing you can see on it is like kitchen knives, but people like me that have restrictions on because someone forgot the passcode, and Apple canít do crap to change it, canít use the app. How am I supposed to get my bearded dragons supplies now?"
BigButton,,1,"Would be nice to sort orders by delivery. 
So you can see whatís coming next. 
And be able to ìtickî off an order that has been delivered already. 

Normally a good app, could be better. 
But. 
Tracking seems to be never working.  
Changing wish list doesnít always work. 

Main thing!
Getting very annoying to have suggested from my wish list, but the items were in my wish list like 18 months plus ago!!! And now others, nothing to do with anything. 
Waste of time!

And when you go app support you just get pages of how to do this and that. Never ìapp supportî"
leavemealonegodsake,,1,It does not let you cancel your order!!!!!!!! Will definitely not recommend do not download this app
sineadyogabelly,,1,Not a reliable company to order from. Late with deliveries and no communication with the customer. If you can avoid using amazon then do. Theyíre not worth the money they take from you.
asmith1216,,1,"Very poor, very confusing and doesnít sync with other apps like audible. Also it says I havenít made any purchases yet when I click on the item I want it says already purchased. Very very poor"
GFox80,,2,"I have to agree with Shazbot regarding how annoying it is recently to see items totally unrelated to my shopping trends show in related items. It really does seem like you are looking at someone elseís account.
I found it useful before browsing the homepage but now I will be avoiding it completely. I messaged Amazon about this issue but they did not advise of if this will be fixed or temporary"
the-yorkie-bar-man,,1,"Telling me my password is incorrect, it definitely isnít as itís always been my password. Try to reset by sending me emails but not receiving them. Tried setting up new account but canít as used my email and mobile number before. Tried to contact support but have to log in. Massive floor! Ridiculous and very frustrating!!! A massive let down and very unreliable! Needed to order something desperately for an event and couldnít. This ruined my event and will never forget this. Not what Iíd expect from Amazon ??"
MrsCrouch15,,1,"Surely iPads measure the same, This was too small for mine! Not happy!"
loudmouthmegan12,,1,"I downloaded this ages ago and worked perfectly fine, but since it updated it logged me out and wonít let me log back in at all, which I have to go into my browser to sign in. Please get this sorted."
Purdy-cat,,1,"Since this update I canít view products when I click on them without closing the entire app down. This might have to be done a few times and is quite annoying. 

Please fix!"
Sallar10,,2,"Used to be a reliable and easy to use app. However, the purchasing process now has errors. Adding a new address at checkout fails and it leads to frustratingly re-entering information and then verifying card details."
RyanEricSwell,,2,"Very subtly will charge you extra here and there, will be something like a £2 extra but think theyíll get away with it, or theyíll charge you for the same item twice and try to make out they havenít even if it clearly shows up in your statement. Would be understandable if it happened once but it seems to be something every few times I order something. Also very stubborn customer service too"
987flix,,1,"Iíve just updated and every time I try to go on it, it just closes!!! Totally useless app and so I have to go into browser!! Sort it ASAP please"
Kerr Marin Miller,,4,"Good, but thereís a bug in the app that shows the price amendments for items in your wish list as ëPrice dropped &pound;(the amount)í instead of the actual £ sign. Works fine if the adjustment is in percentages."
tommylucio,,5,I can find everything I need!
doitonprinciple,,1,"I downloaded this app despite the poor reviews, because the amazon site regularly fails to load on my mobile. This app just didnít work. It didnít show any pages, didnít allow me to log in and didnít seem to actually do anything. Amazon - seriously. Itís like you donít want me to actually buy anything!"
w g 7,,2,Very sly the way they make it nearly impossible to print a simple return label
boucottamazon9986,,1,Double charged me for my first order then they have the cheek to say they havenít! I can see my balance! Avoid at all costs
dave.hick@sky .com,,1,Totally unhelpful do not use
Fredsherbet,,4,"Come on Amazon and Apple - work your priorities out, and allow digital purchases in apps. Having to jump into the web and start my search again is such a rubbish experience"
$&&££££&&&@@@&8'bhh,,2,"Used to provide an excellent shopping service. Now if a parcel does not arrive the app is designed so that you have no customer service to speak of. It sends you round in circles from the Order menu. If you contact the Carrier all you get are recorded messages. Prime is now useless service too. You do not get something the next day, more like next week. Terrible service all round."
zaldzu,,1,Needs updating
johgfdcvgdfv,,1,Awful. I can purchase anything but a movie/tv show. Whatever I try there is no way to contact amazon to rectify this.
Lamoie,,1,"Shockingly awful, most of the features donít work."
#Unicornsquad????????,,5,Well this app is kind of a time saver because if you didnít have the app you have to go on google and type in the search bar and type in amazon.co.uk
JaxM11,,1,"Absolute rubbish, cannot see wish lists... it tells me to update the app but when directed it tells me it is up to date. Also Cannot delete purchased items if they are bought elsewhere.... totally useless now.."
99567432,,1,Crashes ios12
KKMP2018,,1,"I have downloaded the latest version of the app and it keeps crashing every time I open it. 

I have deleted and downloaded it again but nothing."
Snugsy Librarian,,2,"Considering how advanced Amazon is supposed to be their app is awful. With any change I make (payment, delivery) I get stuck. Instead buying things I end up watching the endless circle circling. How about making an app which actually enables you to buy something."
Shirazjavaidiqbal,,1,Everytime i open app it shuts down straight away
townsendium,,1,"since the last update the app freezes and crashes near constantly, have to delete and reinstall it multiple times to get it to work. hopefully the next update will fix this."
shazbot84648,,3,"For some reason the ëBased on your recent purchases, ëGet yourself a little somethingí, ëRecommendations for youí are showing the strangest things completely unrelated to my search history, wish list and purchases. It feels like Iím looking at someone elseís account, and I even updated my password because it all seemed off.

The search engine is awful - often there are hundreds of completely unrelated results that have nothing in common with the search term. And thereís so much unregulated junk, and no way to filter our items that would be dispatched from China etc."
Nimchick,,1,Just updated and now it wonít open. Crashes and shuts down. Iíve deleted and re-installed it but no change. Useless.
Loz2381,,1,Updated the app and now canít use it at all. I use this a lot so very frustrating that Amazon havenít tested their updates and leave their customers with no app.
JBsWoman,,1,"I wish I had not done the update, they have removed the Wish List tab from the home screen, now I have to go to menu and select it, not massively important in the grand scheme of things but to me it seems like a step backwards."
KymeWeb,,3,A great app usually but not it doesnít work. I get error code CS11
Moffy43,,1,"Iíve been trying ALLDAY to get onto my Amazon account. Nothing!. Says thereís an error with Amazon bad itís ( supposedly.) being fixed!?.. Iíve reloaded the app, switch my device on bad off, NOTHING!? I need to buy my daughters bday gift. eBay it is then I guess!!... not happy!. ????"
Topaztiger27,,1,"Not only do we have to put up with ësponsored postsí on social media apps now you have included it!

I will use amazon on my pc from now on where I have ad blockers as I HATE ads and I can use the ësmile.amazoní and donate to charity to! Like Iíve said on social media app reviews if I I want to see ads Iíll watch tv or read a magazine and just so weíre clear I do neither of those things. 

Goodbye amazon app."
Joyce35 :'),,1,Canít even use the app
HJR62,,1,Havenít actually been able to open it because it crashes every time
joshycube,,1,Worthless amateur mobile app. I could accidentally order something I did not even want. It is a fraud app.
AntoniÛ,,3,It kept crashing for some reason.
se.user,,1,This app wonít even open. Latest update fails to load. Please release debugged update ASAP!
kezza128,,3,I updated the app last night and it now wonít open up and crashes everytime I try open it. Iíve tried everything uninstalling it reinstalling it turning phone on and off. So annoying normally use this on a pretty much daily
btjuk,,2,"If you switch to another app for a while, then switch back it resets to the amazon front page, with no history for you to be able to find what you were looking at.
Also, the ìrelated to items youíve viewedî section shows totally random items completely unrelated to anything I have viewed.
Only value now is in order tracking and that can be done in safari.
Toast as far as Iím concerned"
GoodReviewsAreHardToFind,,1,"Now includes advertising.
So much for customer first.
I thought you were better than this, Amazon."

eijdfbjdxbejebjxnskwvdxi,,1,"After the new update my app no longer opens, I click it and it throws me out straight away, all updates done, all phone updates done, uninstalled it a million times to see if that was the problem but still the same :("
Bootsgirl41,,3,"Pretty good app but all of a sudden on my iPad it is telling me I canít access the wish lists on this version and that I need to update. There is no update available, so stuck."
Frederico Barata,,1,I just updated and the app doesn't open. Anything related with iOS?
melaniecis,,1,The app wonít open it just crashes despite repeatedly deleting and downloading again
Tiny tears 58,,1,Don't get this app it's corrupted. I had this app on my ipad and it was great but after last update it won't open keeps crashing and won't work at all because it is corrupted. No matter how many times I delete it and reinstall it this app will not work because it is corrupted. Do not get this app.
Very annoyed Amazon app user,,1,"Upgraded iPhone to iOS 12. Updated Amazon app also as recommended. Now it wonít open, just crashes instantly. Apple blame the developer, I blame both. Shockingly poor."
JudyBubbles,,1,It wonít open on iPad even when it says it is compatible.
ffaaya,,2,"Itís very old style and thereís no premium update also some bugs and errors such as you watching prime offers list and select product, when you back, you will find yourself in the beginning of the list."
Xxjazmin1988xx,,1,No longer works since last update. Annoyed as I have just joined prime however can not access the app. Crashes the second you press it
The Angry Hamster,,1,Seriously Amazon .... you can do better than this!
BoyAlecs,,1,so I paid extra for shipping to come sooner and after 2 days of delays I did not get them .... I searched the application for some option and wrote me there that I have to call them and can it costs extra ... What company is this?
babybeaver,,1,"Iíve been struggling for 2 days to open the app. Iíve downloaded it again. Downloaded update, deleted the app several times. Rest my phon. Nothings working any suggestions iphone7 user"
Annoyed721,,1,Currently unable to use as it wonít stay open.  Thumbs down
Garry7wi,,4,So many bugs pls fix them ASAP
Rich2k,,2,"Not a native app and it shows. Everything takes a while to load. Doesnít use standard iOS controls and is just an embedded web page optimised for the phone

For a $1 trillion company youíd think they could develop a native app wouldnít you"
Accyladdy,,1,How a company the size of Amazon can screw up what was once a very good app is beyond me. The app is no longer of any use and so I have stopped using Amazon. Donít waste your time downloading it
Josheyy1997,,1,Crashes every time it loads
Vespa Nicci,,1,How to change a password !! 12 attempts !! Sort it out !!!

I canít even get past the 1st screen and it disappears from my screen

Re-downloaded and the same thing happens, back to the small screen it is then"
Star633,,2,"This used to be a good app but as always every update worsens the user experience. I am no longer able to access my created baby list using the app to view items i want to purchase ie if i go to the list menu all i can see is shopping and wish list. 

Also if i come across an item i would like to save to the baby list the option is no longer available. I instead can only save to my shopping and wishlist. 

It was a complete waste of time setting up the baby list as the functionality is poor."
Snapweasle,,1,"Downloaded, found what I wanted to buy, but could not find the Purchase tab. Deleted app and have reverted to basic web technology."
Bradders981,,3,"The app is useful as itís easy to use and is much quicker than using a browser. You can quickly buy an item, no issues. 
The issue comes when you want to contact a seller, as I had an issue and needed to contact the seller about my order. I messaged them and it was pretty straightforward. The problem was that it didnít send me any notifications to any of the replies, the replies were not even in the same area. Instead I had to dig through menus to find any reply which was very frustrating as it wasted a lot of time."
Tinman#1952,,2,Cannot print return label from iPad app. Even the link in the email sent just opens the Amazon app and still cannot print! Pointless......
Bob mcBobssss,,1,There is so much that does not work I donít know where to start
Mathews mum,,3,"Donít know when the app has been changed as donít use Amazon a lot, but there is no ìprint labelsî on the return label page... I had to log onto the main site on my laptop to do it. The customer services chat didnít have a clue what I meant & just kept sending me emails with different return labels on! The emails come through fine, go to print label tab, get the page with the labels on but canít print the page. Canít even screenshot it as the bar code is too wide & the screen wonít change to landscape with the phone! Useless! This is just on iPhone as my husband says it works on his Samsung (after I used my laptop... ??)"
fazy123455,,1,"I canít open the app, it just crashes before it even loads"
Jamess109,,1,"After searching for something sometimes it sends me to Amazon products. This has happened more then once or twice over a few searches. By advertising me your products like that, itís not going to make me want to buy them or look at them. I see enough of amazon echo rubbish on your main page!"
TechieDan,,3,"Most of he functions in the app work really well, but still Amazon have not allowed kindle books to be purchased through the app (can only get sample and add to a list).

Given people are moving more and more to apps and mobile devices surely feature parity with website should be near, particularly for feature integration with other Amazon services."
abromat,,1,I dont like amazon cause my mum ordered a phone case for my bffs birthday so me and her could match but amazon changed the order and made my phone case a 6s plus wich we didnít order now my bff donít get a birthday present but gets a Christmas present thanks amazon I donít like this app at all!
Lloydy20102010,,2,Come on amazon!! A great and easy to use app for many many years. And now I have upgraded to the iPhone X it has all gone horribly wrong. And it has been this way for many months. The top of the screen can basically be completely unresponsive. Using predictive search doesnít work! When trying to change wish lists to a different person the ìswitchî list is completely unresponsive. I cannot believe you arenít aware of this and even more amazed you havenít fixed this bug! Pls work your magic
Hshshsbdj,,1,"App was okay, now it's worse. Have to dig to locate ""Orders"" 

Why change things? Just leave things alone, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Bonezmi16,,1,why oh why do you keep adding items iíve bought as dash buttons! i donít want to buy somethingís over and over again! if i want dash buttons iíll add them. but noooo amazon add dash buttons automatically for you and for random things as well! i donít need/want a car stereo dash button ffs!!
Steve :o),,1,Unable to print labels from any iOS devices anymore !
FieldAgent,,3,That thing where the first search you do gets ìforgottenî and you get shown a bunch of Amazon Kindles and Echos instead? Stop it.
Sc0ttish,,1,Paid for my product and it was sent back before it got to me. Told I have to wait till they get it back before they will refund me and I can buy it again. I live 5 days post from anywhere so 15 days to receive my product no thanks.
Bakuras,,1,"The app could be worse to be honest, however I give one star as I find discussing that every time we open the app, start typing and press search, it goes to all this amazon/alexa products which I did not wish to search.

I then have to press back and type everything again. Do you really think that you will sell more of your stuff by tricking customers? How does that work? I want to buy a battery charger, Alexa or whatever comes up, and thatís what Iím going to buy then??? Really???? Poor ethics shown here..."
wests123455,,1,"Rubbish. Just been going around in loops when trying to purchase something, asking for my delivery address and payment details repeatedly without any indication that I was doing something wrong. Ended up not buying it."
Aziz Rahman (Sussex),,1,"Doesnít the Amazon app team know the iPhone X is now available and the screen size is different to the older phones!

This app is wholly inadequate for the new iPhone X screen. Itís as if itís a half baked amazon website squeezed into a phone. 

Ultimately it makes it harder to research product  details and decide what to buy. 

Wake up Amazon!!"
1.24E+11,,2,Donít like the app and AMAZON overall. I bought something and it was keep saying my card was invalid when it was fine. And the rip you of so much.
.iMike.,,1,Now you canít swipe left to go back to search results while viewing a product.
Blackpool1975,,2,Since last update the app seems to freeze more and keep getting error messages a lot too. Please fix. Was fine before you started playing with it.
Saint-Just007,,1,"Works well. Why the one star? Because I cannot be arsed to repeatedly fill a capcha to prove I am not a robot. It did not exist before, and is immensely annoying. Do what everyone else seems capable of doing, use my fingerprint or face recognition if you want to keep my custom."
lolzypies,,1,"Iím broadly speaking about the company Amazon. Very displeased with their service. Iím a student and signed up for the 6 month deal and it has been playing up constantly ever since. It keeps saying that I have Prime then not and so on so forth. So sometimes I get free P&P and other times I do not.
I have called up amazon numerous times, every time they fix the problem it works for a bit then it is back to square one. Also had problems trying to use Amazon video app. Not as much of a powerful corp after all.."
200646,,1,You open the app to see item advertised then canít find it !!!!!
Amazonian 68,,5,"I shop at Amazon, the navigation is easy and quick, you can find what you are looking for.

IcurusJ,,2,"I really like this app and use it on a daily basis. However, I recently upgrade to an iPhone XS and installed this app and it kills the battery. Even with background refresh off the battery is drained very quickly. Removed the app and my Phone now has plenty of charge all day. I hope Amazon fix this soon, so I can re-install."
pr-cork,,3,Refuses to open - very annoying!!

lily cummins,,3,"Itís a great website if you want to buy things online.

UK business traveller,,1,"Installed it on an iPhone 5C which is stuck on iOS 10. App is supposed to work iOS 9 and later. It opens, a couple of seconds later the 
screen goes black, and it disappears. It is not a crash as such because the app is still there in the background but as soon as you click on it again it does the same thing."
Mikewarren23,,4,"I love the amazon app, easily the most used app on my phone! The only thing Iíve found that doesnít work that great is the lists function. 
Clicking ìview listsî simply doesnít work, and can find no other way to view or manage lists from in the app. 
I find myself going to the amazon website to do this instead!"
Uhdyt,,1,Useless app. After working the first few days and appearing quite good it now crashes and shuts down every time I open it so is unusable.
Ksv83,,2,Everytime i use the app to view tracking history it crashes. All i can see is a white screen. I am unable to view the locker codes. Causing real trouble to get the items ordered. I use iphonex. I even deleted thr app and reinstalled it.

Nutella2013,,2,"I canít track my order, the page goes blank. Also service used to be better, I had to get a refund for 2 items the same week that never arrived. Sellers should have more checks done before allowed to sell on amazon."
James Wilson (oyster baby),,1,"How ridiculous, a multi-billion dollar empire such as Amazon can't even maintain an app that allows me to buy stuff, maybe they don't want any more of my money."

Joshua Fennell,,2,"I have literally just been informed my package will be up to two days late, despite me getting informed 5 mins ago the package was a few streets away...

Neven azavedo,,1,I missed my flight coz of late delivery
Naaiima29,,5,"Iíve been using this app for a while now and I have found it to be very useful. It is very easy to search through and buy items. 
When youíve bought an item, it gives you notifications of when it will arrive and when it has been delivered. It also gives updates on items youíve put in your list, if thereís been any changes. 
Overall quite good and easy to use"
Tessableahcar,,2,"I donít want to buy one of your echo things. If I did I would search for it. Forcing me to see it every time I want to search for something, losing what I was searching for so I have to retype in what I was searching for, just makes me really annoyed and highly unlikely to want to buy an echo thing.  If there wasnít the convenience of Prime and amazon lockers I would stop using amazon altogether."
RichyRichtheRich,,1,"Perhaps amazon are becoming too big...the app is poor...canít see tracking for deliveries (just a blank page).
Not very impressive."
Britinexile,,1,"For ages I wondered why I couldnít buy kindle books with this app: you only get an option to download a sample.

Iíve bought loads of physical books at a higher price and paid postage to France (where I live) and waited for them to arrive by post.

I find this incredibly poor from Amazon and would give the app zero stars if I could.

I heard on the news a month or two back that kindle sales were in decline.  Perhaps this why?

Sort yourselves out Amazon!!!

Iím deleting the app and will revert to the web interface."
ruvhb,,3,"I use this app a lot. Itís got most of what I want when shopping at Amazon but what it DOESNíT do is allow me to support my chosen charity with the Smile.Amazon link.

Unhappy99999,,1,The app defaults to last used delivery address and submits an order when proceed to checkout is clicked. I have had to cancel so many orders. It makes me furious. When using on computer it automatically changes my currency even though ive selected british pounds and before ive selected my card. How can usability be this bad?
DamianC1999,,2,Now unable to see delivery updates...
Sh34rs,,1,Every time I try to use the amazon app it crashes and closes with 30 seconds.
Euphoric.Solstice,,1,When trying to track an item the screen goes white and the app crashes. This has been happening for about a month now. With every update there seems to be more and more bugs added. Amazon use to be the most solid of apps but now it has more issues than I can count.
Leanke,,1,"Some years ago  deleted the original app because it was designed as a shop window and you couldnít make purchases.
This  marginally better, you can make some purchases but you canít buy kindle books. Since thatís the main thing I buy from Amazon, that makes the app useless for me so Iím deleting it again.
Also there are problems adding things(like kindle books) to your wish list. 
Your purchases donít count towards Amazon Smile either."

mattbagwell,,5,"Great app, easy to use but would be perfect if it had a feature where you can print out invoices of goods bought instead of having to go online and do it through the website, it would be easier and better to do it through the app as Iím always on it and never go online"

2. If they can track the location of some drivers, why do they always get lost and drive right past my place whilst Iím watching them on the map updates?
3. Why does prime next day delivery mean only possibly the next day and mostly the day after?
4. Why, when my account was compromised was it so quick to refund but totally impossible to get straight answers about who and how my credit card and email was being used on a .com account to purchase monthly prime when I was already a yearly .co.uk prime member who prepaid for a year????
5. Why is it impossible to get a detailed full invoice of all my purchases this year in an email or spreadsheet summary?
6. Why do only some returns register, why canít amazon force all vendors to use a proper tracked return service to avoid disputes? I always keep my Royal Mail proof of sending but in most disputes itís not been valid or just ignored!
7. PLEASE use English speakers for English people!! So sick of repeating myself and struggling to understand the crazy accents and back to front emails?
8. Why does the app not properly update refund information?
9. Refunding postage to China should be standard, itís not fair that only certain vendors will refund postage on returns?
I LOVE amazon, but the app drives me crazy!!!"
BetReview,,1,"You would think that with the main aim of this app making buying things from your phone easy, that this would be at least possible. Iíve tried to use this app on several occasions, on different networks/WiFi connections, to no avail. Iíve been unable to complete the checkout page, as anytime I try to change the delivery options the app seems unable to handle it and gets stuck on a loading page. 

I assume this app would work if you didnít need to change your delivery options (were happy with your saved default address/default delivery time)."

locsphere,,1,So I have had over 6 items that just never show up in time despite paying for the prime service. Never once has this been honored. They keep saying I just had to wait one more day. For instance I had item that was supposed to arrive the 3rd and it is now the 6th. They said if I waited one more day I would have qualified. Because itís new date said tomorrow the 7th. Some items just never showed at all. Just really tired of this happening where I have to wonder if the item I ordered will arrive on time. So ready to just cancel the prime membership altogether. Donít have to have it to order.

For example, I order a new system for my car. It arrived as described but the key blank was the wrong size, as said in the ad. I called Amazon Tech help to try and find the right key blank I needed and the customer support agent swiftly found what I need & compensated me for the part I need and $40 for the issue!

I moved half a year ago and made many purchases shipped to the new address. Every time I had to carefully select the shipping address. Why is the Amazon app NOT SMART enough to rank the most recent address highest on the address list? Why isnít there a default address I could select in the App? 

I had to delete all my previously saved addresses just now to avoid such a mistake happen again! It has caused so much inconvenience the whole time and monetary loss associated with the wrong order. Iím paying for the prime service but I had such bad user experience!

kcherille,,2,Amazon is an OK place to get restaurant delivery among other thingsÖ The only thing that I can say about Amazon is that when you have a review that they donít like they wonít post it. Which kind of tells me that they are manipulating the customer. I recently ordered something and the Vendor cancel that it came from China went to Portland and then it said it was delivered to me so I posted a review about it and Amazon would not print it. Iím usually one of person that goes off of reviews good and bad but itís pretty sad when you only see good reviews and not enough battery is a know the difference if itís really good or really bad I donít like being manipulated like that.

EcommTester,,1,"When the app is used instead of the desktop there is not an option to select a pick up locker location it lists the address of the locker. The USPS does not have access to the locker locations and instead delivers packages to unknown addresses and the orders must be refunded because they have not been received by the customer that ordered the product. In addition, calls to customer service are not helpful, they are kind and try to help but really do not have a complete understanding of what is happening. Each delivery is attempted multiple times and does not find the locker location and must be returned to the sender and refunded to the purchaser. The APP needs an update which determines the delivery method and resolves the customer pickup location to be a locker then logistics to complete the transaction. Looking forward to this convenience working effectively on the APP."

However, in recent days, youíve decided to remove all Prime videos that you donít agree with and I donít find that censorship very cool. There are a million documentaries out there, some bogus and some good. Let people decide for themselves because control is not a good look for you. Just to be clear- itís not me, ITíS YOU. In the future, if Itís clear that you truly understand the meaning of liberty, that each individual has their own brain to hopefully use well, and their own choices to make, I may return.

The shipping process is frivolous other than that reanalyzing the shipping situation would be much oblige.

Brettbeachboy,,1,The customer support people seem entirely incompetent... and unable to help with the simple issue of setting up my existing prime account in the ap. After twenty minutes they offered no other solution than to sign in on a different device. Because apparently itís the device and not the incompetent customer support. After emailing photos and everything of what the problem was they still seemed to have little to no understanding of the English language or what the issue at hand was. This app would be great if my prime membership could get set up on it.
kevinm626,,2,"I downloaded the app into my new phone and none of my order history is here anymore, also any item I want to buy says it canít be delivered to the United States, I even checked brands that were only made in the U.S. and it still says the same thing. What am I supposed to do now???"
Ashot Arzumanyan,,2,Where is the awesome customer service? I have to talk to a poor bot for my request!
jolaroux,,1,"I find many things wrong with this app design in 2019.

The appís design is obviously just webUI elements loaded in, which worked well in its time, but now feels clunky and painful to use.  

Also, *how* is this app not updated for the 2018 iPad Proís yet?
This is a joke, obvious lack of respect for the platform, and user.

This has legitimately made me spend less money on Amazon!

For the biggest component of the company, such little care spent (visible), makes no sense.

Please fix!"

Say itís supposed to come Monday, it doesnít end up showing up. Lately for me, i believe ups are going to the wrong address which is why my package is never on time now. Itís a bit upsetting. I might just stop shopping on Amazon if this keeps up."

Dnwr12,,1,Update for New iPad Pro
nishiko73,,2,"it is ridiculous the ipad app (on Air 2) does not allow scanning barcodes like on the phone app.  fix this... now i have no use for this app on my ipad over just using the browser, so uninstalling."
itz_jenna,,1,My freaking honeycomb hasnít been here in three days!
DJ Masta,,1,"I am surprised. One would think Amazon, one of the biggest companies in the world, would have a rock solid app. This app has clearly not been updated in a long time. Itís very slow, and not optimized for 12.9î iPad Pro. No multitasking, not full screen. Iím better off going to the website in safari. This app feels like a crappy blown up android tablet app from 2014. Not happy."
Soze111,,3,Last update screwed up the screen size on my 11î iPad. This is an iOS app - what are developers thinking?
Jud/eee,,2,Amazon account keeps referring me to customer service which I cannot use because I do not remember the expiration date of my Discover card which was probably four years ago and Iíve gotten another one since And do not remember the expression date of the first card and there is no way I can contact them about this and it keeps asking the same question and wonít let me go any further until I answer that question even if I start over it ask that question and thereís no phone number so I guess I canít buy anything from AmazonItís a flaw they need to fix there needs to be a phone number when you canít get past things like

An updated shouldnít bring you to your last purchase, remember what was in your cart, let you get to checkout then make you log in when your already logged in!!!"

Nightslice,,1,"I purchased nike women shoes shox size 8, they sent me 4x man t-shirt , i was so disappointed ."
ebassily,,3,"Amazon is a great marketplace if not the greatest on the planet. However, the Amazon shopping app continues to be lagging behind in terms of the shopping experience (although the process is convenient, but the interface is not), the whole UI of the app, not natively supporting the new XS Max resolution and many more. The UI is very cluttered and should be much simpler. I suggest they get a UI designer to help them do a good job, as it really needs overhauling, even the website and not just the app. 
The iPhone XS Max and XR have been out for months now and the app got updated many times after that, last was probably yesterday, but have not yet cared to support the new resolutions of these phones. From a company like Amazon we expect such updates to be prompt."
AlphaTK,,3,"Thereís no interface with Amazon Smile, and browsing through searched products is painful."
KyleMaier,,2,Still not updated to new iPhone screens
Scruabble,,2,Disgusted.  Ready to quit Amazon.  It won't let me put in an old email address. Says there is a problem.  It says it is already in use.  The problem is Amazon!

structures,,3,App works good. Only problem I have is the iphone has a feature where you tap up at the top of the phone and in theory it auto scrolls to top of the page. The problem is on the amazon app I try this after scrolling down on a product I am looking at and I either hit the back button or the amazon home screen. This loads a new page and I have no way of getting back to the product.  Sometimes I canít find the product again. A back and fwd button would be a nice addition for every page within the app.

Robert234,,1,"With this update, as well as the previous one, Amazon has taken its iPad app into a time machine ó back to the 1990's of web and application design. This is the most awkward looking presentation of goods for sale I've seen since the inception of eBay."

Koranek,,1,Still lacks support for the new iPads. Looks extremely outdated.
extremebridge2019,,1,I get confused with Amazon Prime And Third Party Shippers That Charge Higher Prices And No Free Shipping.  Needs Transparency.  Too Much Advertising And Clutter.  I Find Some Items Cheaper At My Local Walmart.  Amazon Isnít Always The Cheapest.  Biggest Worry Is My Package Will Be Stolen Vs A Quick Trip To Local  Walmart.  Amazon Prime Is Getting Expensive.
Bee144,,1,Latest iPads have been out for months yet there is no support for amazon apps. Please fix this!
dglindsey23,,1,"For a company so reliant on technology to collect and process orders, Iím shocked at how out of date the iPad app is. Looks like it was made for the first generation iPad? Makes the app fairly unusable until this gets fixed. Please look into a simple update that will take advantage of all the new iPad screen sizes."
Tri Guy number 546,,1,"Please add the Whole Foods card to ìApple Wallet!î

Every time I go to the local Whole Foods store, they question me on the card, and the phone service inside that store is virtually non-existent.  The staff even tells people they need to connect to the internet, and open the Amazon app.  Then click to get the card... all the while, thereís a line of angry mob behind me, to get 10% off the bottle of water I came in to buy.  From a customer perspective, it is very frustrating, and honestly makes me want to just shop elsewhere so I can just type in my phone number like at Dillons grocery store. 

If you insist on having me scan a card... then please get with the times and add Apple Wallet functionality.  Thanks."
JenErosity,,1,Really buggy on iPad Pro
rdnredone,,5,I am doing more and more shopping with Amazon. I love the App. I find anything I want. Amazon has the best customer service that I have ever had to deal with. Even though thatís not App related I just had to mention it. Well Iím sure if someone had a problem with the App Amazon customer service would help.
ashleyrose2014,,1,At the beginning I liked amazon but when I cancel the membership and YOU STILL CHARGE ME THE 126 EVEN THOUGH I CANCELLED IT! If you are reading this do not do business with them. This is nothing but a scam. Iíll make sure to let people know how you do business. Thanks for making me low on my rent!!

Marcelo2069,,1,Runs very slowly on my 7Plus...
Slarvey,,1,While the app ran great; this past update killed it. It runs so and is constantly loading - whether on WiFi or cellular. Not what you did but judging by reviews we know what you didnít do.
chrisb2286,,1,Iíve had amazon prime for YEARS I buy something once a week if not more... I just bought an $8 screen cover then I get an email that my account has been put on hold I can of course still pay my membership but canít make any purchases so I call customer service and they tell me I canít make purchases that my account has been put on hold however I can still make my membership payments... what? And when I ask why they said lack of payment I said uhhhh I pay with a card it come out right then would u like to see my bank statements she said not necessarily bc it shown i paid in their system however still have to be put on hold until they could figure out what happen on their end... so I canceled my membership I felt as if I was being scammed for more money and didnít feel safe having my info with them anymore
Jieming,,1,"Don't ever try to chat with customer service with this app. It will lose connection and the chat will be lost.  All progress in resolving your issue will be lost. Other than that, there's a bunch of things you can't purchase with the app and it requires you to log in to a web browser. It's almost useless."
dchild98,,1,They never deliver when they say they will missed my package twice and have had packages stolen because they will deliver on a different day while you are at work. Everything is from third party sellers so must things are extremely cheap. Probably not using amazon ever again

kkandpapa,,1,"I agree with ì annoyed shoppingî. You feature an item, but when I click on it, itís nowhere to be found."
mauler9m,,4,"I love the app. It works exactly as it should and is very easy to use. That being said, the one thing I donít get is why I canít purchase a Prime Video from this app or the Prime Video app. I kinda get the Prime Video app is more set up to stream the content rather than purchase it so I get that. But this app is suppose to basically replace the need to go through a browser to buy things from Amazon except for Prime Videos. If they fix this I would give it 5 stars."
Sloan_1,,1,"1) I never take the time to review apps, so you know this is bad. (LONG TIME Amazon customer of 16 years)
2) Browsing in their curated ìhomeî section and Iíll see something that catches my eye, but before I can click on it the list will shoot me to a few pages scrolled down making me lose my beloved item and the process all too frustrating & confusing to re-find. Happened 5 times this morning before I gave up.
3) Mystery box giveaways constantly saying ìstill loadingî or some ìbe-bop boopî b.s. where youíre supposed to think theyíre being cute as the page spins when attempting click on a giveaway item. Tried it w/3-4 items before REALLY giving up by deleting the app entirely. 
Iíd rather use my desktop computer than this poor, inept excuse for a shopping app. The likelihood of me actually going on my desktop to re-find and re-buy all these items is realistically slim to zero. You lost lots of money from me today Amazon."
tino pedula,,2,Shows lots of items not related to search. Also show items for selected seller not for all sellers just the one who maybe pay their way to be promoted ?

Amazon prime is trash Iím definitely unsubscribing
ThatTechNerd,,4,"I want to start this by saying that I am a frequent online shopper. From clothes to furniture, I do it online. The issue I am recognizing here is that, you can't split screen it with another app. I don't think it would be hard to integrate, too. Other than that, app works great."
Awesome mechanics,,1,I downloaded this app because of a notification that I would receive $10 from signing in through the app. I clicked on the notification and was sent to a webpage that confirmed this. It said there would be a coupon code under the bell icon. No coupon code and too much extra hassle to do purchasing on iPhone.
Jdnejcnejkdnendj,,3,"The appís interface is very confusing when buying an item. Also I had a problem with canceling an item, when I tried to cancel an order it would take me through confusing verifications and I was left wondering if I actually successfully canceled the order. But to my surprise, a few days later the item I had canceled had arrived at my doorstep. AND I had heard from some other people that they have had the same problem I had: does not fully cancel an order. But issues aside, the app is convenient for buying items from a wide selection of cheap items"

Themusicman08,,1,"So Amazon has once again decided to come out with an update to this application. Thatís great! Except for one thing. Every time Amazon doesnít update, it seems to mess with voiceover on an iOS device. Iím not sure why Amazon needs to update their application every time, but they are forgetting that voiceover users do exist. The last time that this happened, we were not able to access the search feature very well because according to voiceover, there were letters, strings of numbers, and punctuation symbols that didnít exist on the screen. Did you guys forget that the last time that this happened there were several complaints about this from voiceover users? Also Iíve noticed that now when you search for products or a product itís not possible to filter out just to prime. The scrolling is horrible and if we talk to Amazonís customer service, they donít understand what weíre talking about when it comes to accessibility or voiceover. Amazon! Please fix the accessibility and put it back to the way it was. It would really help us a lot. Itís bad enough that we canít use your accessible website on a computer to search for what we want to find or buy. Every time we use that, your accessibility site redirect to the normal Amazon site. Think of it this way. Our money as as good as anyone elseís."

I find this happening more and more. ALASKA is a US state and the items are not heavy!!! I order stuff from wish ... sent no problem FROM CHINA!! EBAY NO PROBLEM.

Brittday20,,1,I absolutely loved Amazon decided to get the app to track my orders more thoroughly. Tracking is never accurate and using the delivery instructions is a waste of time. Never received any of my packages after paying for Prime and due to me being upset about never receiving my items and requesting MY money back for items I never received or at least wanting them to try to reship said items they canceled my account. Just a sad excuse for a company that promotes having great customer service and quality delivery services.
Connor O'Rourke,,5,Great App
TBTOA,,1,"The reviews on Amazon that once made it great are now trash. Looking for a iPhone charger and all 100% 5 star reviews. We all know thatís not right. So filter it out to only verified purchases and there are none. I cannot buy from scammers, and thatís what this is. So disappointed."
Michael.adams,,3,It would be really nice if in the audible app I could download things while browsing my phone. instead I have to jump apps or devices to make the ìpurchaseî with my tokens to get books to download.

not-smiling,,1,"After spending thousands of dollars with Amazon I have just been told that none of my purchases will go towards the Amazon Smile organization that I designated. Customer service tells me that you cannot do Amazon Smile through the app. They said you must purchase through a browser on your phone or on a computer. That is very disappointing and very convenient for Amazon, especially when you look up a purchase up in a search engine and it goes directly to the app when you click that link. Why is Amazon making it so hard to send the proceeds to your designated organization?"
Addy/tepig/cupcake sprinckles,,3,"I like the app. I use it ALL the time. I have an issue with 2 things.
1. I need to be able to print a ìreceiptî for what I have purchased. I can always see my orders but I cant see the payments to them in a receipt form.
2. On my iPad I canít scroll through options like color or size. I can only see what opens in the tiny window without turning my iPad vertically which means I canít use my keypad. Very annoying when I am searching several versions of an item. Frustrating enough Iíve cut the app off."
Rabidcharlie,,3,"Application works fine for me. Wish it was easier to save items that I have contemplated purchasing without adding to cart. One thing that is extremely disappointing is meeting community guidelines to rate a product that was purchased. I donít buy a lot and didnít meet criteria to rate the product. I feel that if I buy something, rating it is a given. Another way to strong-arm people into 
spending more. The reality is I was going to give it an outstanding rating and talk very positive about the product purchase. So you and the seller lose out on a good review.  It also took the ratings and stars down on the app review as well.  You should consider changing this."
Jae Ramsis,,5,I had written a horrible review in this app but it turns out that it was a user error on my part. I had fixed the issue and the app works perfectly.
55621,,2,Idk if anyone else is having this problem but the shopping cart is so frustrating. It always crashes and you have to close the app to get it to work. Sometimes two or three times. Seriously amazon....can you not fix this?
??Tandy??,,2,Since I got Amazon prime it has been nothing but bad lucky. I might as well stick to traditional shopping. Customer service donít care at all I guess as long as they got there money screw how people feel. I am paying for amazon prime and get treated like crap. Soooooo not satisfied.

Multiple times amazon has failed to deliver in that promise, yes I understand itís not perfect, but when you promise to get things to the customer in 2 days then you should deliver. When I signed up for prime they had the 2 day promise or a month free of prime. Big joke!!! First time I didnít get my delivery in 2 days they said that policy was out of date. Great customer service! Customer is always right, never said by Jeff Bezos. Anyway, tonight had a package said it was delivered. It wasnít, and guess what...amazon blamed the delivery status on the carrier. Saying they couldnít do anything about the status being scanned in as delivered, but I paid for 2 day delivery. Did amazon offer a monetary compensation, hahahahaha no they didnít! I guess if itís too good to be true it is! Lady I talked to was as useful as a poopy flavored lollipop. Just wish amazon would own up to its own faults like all other companies have too! Dealing with amazon customer service is harder than getting Democrats and Republicans to agree on anything. Take your money somewhere else, and donít let fake promises foul you!"

HmongGuy1990s,,1,"It has been two or three weeks from now and since then the app started getting lag whether I tap on cart, show options menu, go back, etc. It took a while for the app to load. Other apps on my phone and iPad load faster than this Amazon app. Uninstall and reinstall the app does not fix the issue. There should be an update to fix this issue. I am using iPad Pro 10.5 and iPhone 7 Plus. By the way, browsing using the app is easier than the website. It took to long to load a page to the point I have to restart my Devices.I enjoy using the app  to, but not that it have too many bugs that make the app slows down. Amazon developers should look into this issue and fix it so it wonít take too much time for the app to load. This happened so many times already."
Edward the old cowboy,,1,"I am happy with the Amazon website, but the Amazon app is a huge disappointment.  The biggest reason is it just does not have the functionality or the logical progression of use that comes from learning to use the website.
My biggest beefs are not being able to page through the history of purchases or Items viewed, Iím not even sure I can see my wish list.
But the biggest single issue is I have been trying to purchase a book from Audible while traveling with only iOS devices.  The problem is a combination of Audible not allowing in app purchases.  The Amazon app does not allow purchasing audible books from the Amazon app.  But to pour salt into the wound I canít get to the Amazon webpage from my iOS device because when I do it just default back to the app.  
So do NOT try to use this awful app.  Sorry Amazon, you need to do better."

Bmoote2,,3,"Whatever upgrade was made to apparently
move away from native iOS structures has resulted in slower user experiences. Tapping the filter box takes a fill two beats to open the box and wait for items to load. Search results seem to take longer now. Not impressed. Amazon used to be so seamless in quickly allowing the user to navigate... now the user hates it and offers the web expedience. How backwards."

Molybdenum trioxide,,1,"This app provides a worse experience than the browser version of Amazon. Links to products pull you into this app, which then fail to load, or redirect you back to a web browser.

It isn't consistent enough to be used reliably, so, it's deleted. Amazon can send me almost any physical product in a day, but they can't make a reasonable mobile app..."
Suzy NYC,,3,"I like the shopping app, but I have so many boxes and plastic wrap to throw out! I feel sad about wasting so much material. Especially since I know how bad plastic is for oceans and how many billions of trees are sacrificed for this. Hopefully, Amazon will give me a choice for eco-friendly or reusable delivery materials. Iíd pay more for that. For now, I order only small things on Amazon and anything that requires more packaging (especially food!), I buy locally."

CheeksMcGee,,1,Amazon is a shopping site but this app does not allow purchases so itís unclear to me what itís good for. You have to go out to a web browser app to actually buy something. Which makes the app pretty much useless.

ajrule,,3,"I enjoy shopping online. Iím a homebody. So mobile app shopping is where itís at for me for those quick buys I donít have the time or energy to run out and get myself. Iím not picky, pretty easy to please when it comes to this. A good variety, basic ease of use, and feedback options and Iím good to go.

Iíve been using this amazon app for a while now and have noticed that lately, especially since I moved to my iPhone XS Max and iOS 12, it has become extremely slow almost to the point itís unusable. Iíve deleted and redownloaded the app, hard reset my phone and nothing seems to fix it. Opening the app and accessing the home screen takes forever let alone searching for anything.

Iím also noticing more and more items arenít deliverable to my address. The only difference is I now live in a secure apartment building that has accessible delivery options. Increasingly, however, I am having to order more and more items to nearby friends or family addresses for seemingly simple items. Sometimes even from the same source one item is fine but another is undeliverable.

Overall itís a great app as far as ease of us and interface, when it works. What gives guys?"
fjurugt td,,2,"I had an alternative Amazon app and they just stopped the support for it so I had to switch to this one. The layout of the other one was better - it just took one click to see my orders or lists instead of whole foods and prime which I never use. Another annoying thing is whenever I click the app icon from the home screen, even if I haven't closed the window, it takes me back to the home page instead of picking up where I left off. It's quite frustrating when I'm in the middle of researching a product and have to start the search again."
Nikki7776676,,1,The new update is awful! App doesnít show items anymore. New low to high system doesnít work properly. Very new update seems to make the app worse. Not impressed.
Kidiotic,,2,This app is so slow now. I donít know what they did to it but it used to be so much faster. Every new screen takes like a good 7 seconds. Itís definitely not my phone as thatís the only app I have a problem with
Pokemonmasterchamp,,1,Make sure to screen shot your purchases & keep track of double charges. I called customer service & they couldnít help with anything. They just asked me questions not dealing with my problem

Iíve been buying off Amazon for almost 20 years and never had an issue that couldnít be resolved by contacting Amazon directly.

Nika11az,,1,"I've been an Amazon prime customer for years and I was happy to download the app, but the app itself crashes, is not responsive, and overall it's been a PIA so I had to remove it. I hate it that the featured deals and other things that pop up in my feed try to ""force open"" the app when I click on them and that I don't get the option to go to the same item via my regular browser. I walked away without purchasing at least a dozen times so far because of this stupid app. I guess my gain is Amazon's loss; apparently I didn't want/need those items that badly anyways, so I held onto my money and Amazon lost out on multiple sales. Not that they're hurting for revenue / profit. Oh well...."
Jyunte,,3,"If you use TouchID on the 2017 iPad Pro, and you have 2FA enabled, then TouchID will not log you in - you'll get a password incorrect error.

Steps to recreate the issue:
1) Sign out if already logged in
2) Manually sign in using username, then enter password, then your 2FA (eg. Authenticator App), check the box to disable requiring the Authenticator code on the iPad Pro. Press the login button. You will be logged in.
3) Sign out.
4) Sign in. Type in your username. Click Continue.
5) Select the button on the keyboard to log in automatically with the password saved by TouchID. Touch the fingerprint reader. TouchID enters your password. Press Continue. Amazon tells you your password is incorrect.

If you try to log in manually, again, you will STILL need to enter in your 2FA code, even though you told the app not to ask for one on this device.

Check.  I have Android and iOS devices and both suffer the same issues (iOS app is slightly better).  Finally got to the point where I just had to uninstall the apps.... Iíd hop online to order a couple of things and waaaaait... freeze.... reload... repeat several times.... what should have taken max of 5 minutes turns into thirty minutes (conservative) ... beyond frustrating. 

You guys should have THE best shopping app (and online/web) - youíre Amazon.  Blazingly fast, slice and dice search refinement ability, and throw in some WOW.  I expect more from the premier online retailer - donít you guys at Amazon expect more from yourselves?  Maybe a corporate or departmental goal of reaching an App rating of at least 4.0 (4.2 challenge) ... by end of 2019.  

Remember - youíre Amazon ??. Now blow us away ??.

I shop almost exclusively from you guys (and promote your site to friends). But it has to be from a computer (which had been slow lately too FYI)."
CashDude,,1,"Bring back the detailed order shipping status on the ìordersî page! I shouldnít have to click on each item to see if it has shipped yet or now. Why are you taking away actual useful features and adding useless ones? 

Now, they just took away the ìprime onlyî button and buried it in the search result filters. Amazonís programmers are totally clueless. 

Also, Amazon needs to actually disclose what is going on in each update (bug fixes, feature requests, etc), rather than just putting advertisements for old features in the ìwhatís newî area. Just because youíre big doesnít mean you can ignore the App Store rules."

It looks like Iím trying to order from a foreign countryís website. Itís terrible!!!! Put it back to the way it was. PLEASE."
Huffca,,1,I am tired of getting alerts new items I have no interest in. Just because at one time I may have been looking for something in the similar category. It made me think that someone was hacking my account. I want to you to stop.  I have called multiple times and attempted to get help. No one could help me asked to speak to a supervisor and was not connected with one. I followed the email instructions. Which are NOT user friendly. I donít want unsolicited sales opportunities. If there is something directly related to an order then yes send me related alerts. So that I can be aware of whatís going on. But when I get an alert on something i did not order it makes me start thinking someoneís hacking my account.  Please stop the insanity! As much as I like Amazon and in my Amazon prime I am going to spread my story and possibly And my subscription!

Peterp9999,,1,How has one of the biggest companies in the world still not updated their app to support the new aspect ratio on the 2018 iPad Pro? The iPad Pro has been out for over 3 months now. Despicable
RanaSjsu,,1,The app is slow as hell.
AMPalmerX,,1,"I really love this app, but I bought a gummy bear album CD album in December of last year and they never sent it.  They told me that it had already been bought, yet it would get shipped to me by February 8 and it never came in yet.  Itís past the eighth.  Iím not really happy about that.  I expected to receive exactly what I bought from you guys.  Iím not leaving a five star rating until I get that CD.  I really want to still give you guys a five star rating because of how much I love amazon plus I get a lot of slightly to severe damaged CD cases.  I assume thatís not your fault, yet the fault of UPS since I met somebody who works there and he mentioned thereís no such thing as careful handling with even packages they know has breakable items in there.  If I get that CD that I ordered, I will change the one star to a five star."
Leecie924,,4,"Why doesnít Amazon have a filter for Price Range? I love Amazon and everything it about it, but I need a price range filter. This would help narrow down my searches way faster."
Truth juice,,1,I would love it if it worked!! Been down for months what going on??!
kskippe,,1,Come up with a home page that doesnít have the items you think we want Iím so tired of seeing that freaking box that nobody ever wins !??
Mom24monsters,,1,"Word of mouth must not mean much to Amazon anymore, because as many items as I used to share until this update, I can no longer share items. I use voiceover, and Lord knows where the share button went, because now I can no longer share items with family and friends. Thanks Amazon, you just made things more difficult for somebody who pretty much shopped for everything on Amazon. That wonít be happening much anymore until this gets fixed. I know lots of other visually impaired people who used to shop the same way and wonít be able to anymore. Besides not fixing that issue, it becomes sluggish when scrolling through a long list of items when voiceover is on. The farther down you go, the more sluggish it gets, and it doesnít get better when you scroll back up, if it even lets you. I have to close the app and reopen it in the app switcher before it will work properly. The sluggishness started with the update that I installed today."
TryJoy26,,3,"After I do a search on the app, I get the results, and of course, thereís hundreds and/or thousands of items that I filter through. I would scroll/browse though the list of items and select one of the items for more info on it, and then tap the ìbackî button (arrow) to get back to the browsing list. However, when I tap the back button, it sends me all the way to the top of the list. Thatís very annoying after having scrolled through such a long list of items, meaning that Iím having to scroll back through every thing again and again every time I select one item for more info. Is there any way to fix this? I have the latest update, so I know thatís not the problem. Essentially, itís time-consuming, annoying, and makes you NOT want to continue to look for something to buy. Please fix.

UPDATE: Issues have gotten worse. Even with the update, the app lags horribly, it crashes in the middle of me browsing, and it goes into ìstill loadingî mode for forever until I hit the back button and try again. It froze today when I pressed checkout while buying an item, and only after getting out of the app and then opening it up again, could I finally see that the payment went through. Please fix this buggy app."
Nicholas Blitzer,,2,I was browsing through Amazon trying to find shoes for my brother. I then 5 days later I get a package with new Harden 3ís. Do not recall ordering it. The only thing I can think of is that I accidentally touched the one click button and ordered it on accident.
SO ANNOYED PERSON,,1,"So I bought a product like I normally do through Amazon prime. This time it said it was delivered but it never got delivered even they said it themselves that it got mis-scan so I waited for 2 more days and it never came. So they said to reorder it and they will pay for the expedited shipping but it was a lie because I still paid for the shipping myself and never got refunded for the previous purchase. So in the end, I bought two times what I needed and had to pay EXTRA for the ship when I'm a prime membership myself. RIDICULOUS AND UNFAIR WHEN I WAS PROMISED AND THEY DON'T KEEP THEIR WORDS."

Klak15,,1,Last update caused other issues. Ap freezing up when trying to view shopping cart and check out.
pernipicus,,2,This is the only online retailer where you can spend thousands of dollars on and still not be ìeligibleî to review. Seems very ridiculous to me; Amazon needs to be less exclusive.
JasonA2z,,2,"I would like to be able to access amazon influencer pages through the app. Customer service informed me that I would have to use a desktop computer to view pages on amazon. I only ever use my phone to order from Amazon and I know I would order more if I could see and access links through the app. Also, there would be more traction for pages if they could link directly to the app and followers could use their phone app to purchase."

Kimberly!33,,2,"Got to tell you, I buy a lot on amazon. I work in retail and donít like to go out shopping after working with the public all week. I recently purchased an item that went on sale the very next day. It was only about a $5 difference but I reached out through chat to amazon to price match. They said they would help me with that after I received it. I went back to chat today to see about the credit, and nope they wouldnít do it. Was really surprised and disappointed. They always take care of there customers but I found out now, apparently they wonít."

Plz update your tracking and packaging features!!!!!!"
Raygar49,,1,Hello everybody I would not recommend using amazon at all. I got $85 in gift cards on Christmas. But because I used a credit card that was not mine and it was on YouTube it was also a gift card they say that I will not be able to purchase or buy anything Iíve called them texted them and they say that the gift card money is lost all I can say is that I was going to pay with my debit card for prime but seems to me that they donít want to fully fix my problem.

Freddy boy22,,1,I can shop but the app gets deleted randomly
Zen master Rob,,1,"App has multiple glitches. For example, on a purchase Iím trying to make thereís the option to change shipping speed, but every time I click it it redirects me to a this page that essentially says ìare you sureî to which I say yes, which redirects me to the same page in an endless loop. Iíve tried for 30+ minutes to just check out on a single item and Iím about to run out of patience and buy from somebody else. 

Also, when I downloaded this app, it was because I was checking out in browser, an amazon popup told me Iíd get a massive discount code on my current purchase if I did. However this discount code didnít apply to anything in my cart, so I was also lied to, and conned into spending time setting up an app I donít need for a promise that wasnít fulfilled. Makes me feel bad."

bob27707,,1,I love comparing prices when shopping and this app lets me do that about 1% of the time.  It almost never works complaining about no internet connection yet every other app works fine all the time.  Itís not like Iím in Cricket wireless or anything. Verizon.  So itís definitely something wit the app.  Frustrating
girl nickname girl,,2,This is a review of Amazon as a whole in addition to the app. The app is great and I have no issue with it. The company I am very unhappy with right now after reading about counterfeit items being sold on the site. This is unacceptable for any company. I highly suggest that anyone concerned about this Google counterfeit on Amazon and think twice about ordering from them.
nucedi,,1,"Shame on them , i order a cover and that cover never come , and i try for refund , and they say me you should wait 10 days for refund , and no sorry , no apologies nothing .

Raspwar,,1,I gave it one star because I canít give it zero. I like the full site and my iPad always wants to default to app.
zevans2,,3,Please optimize the app for the new iPad Pro. It does not stretch to the edges of the display and it looks amateur.
CyndyML,,5,"Iím giving this a 5* review, but I do see room for one improvement. I wish the app had the Look Inside feature. I go through the NYT book review every week, and I need to use the website rather than the app to choose books. This is a tiny little thing, so overall I still think itís an excellent app."
King_pen1,,1,"I placed an order with a seller off amazon. Well only 2 out of 3 of my items were sent and i was fully charged for all 3 items. Them item was never shipped, i messaged the seller about it and the only thing they would do was provide me with a copy of my order details. Them under that stated that if i needed any more help to contact amazon so i did. Il told Amazon they were no help and all Amazon did was gave me a 10.00 credit for my next order (by the way the 10.00 dollars never even showed up at time of check out) even explained that to them. I told the seller showed 3 of those items were in stock. Then after i placed my order it show 1 left in stock. Then Amazon came up with an excuse for the seller saying they didn't up there product in stock. That they were search another warehouse or something. Really!? What kinda sense that make???!! Well then after just talking with Amazon again i told them i should be and feel like i should be entitled for a full compensation for everything i bought. Sense the product never was sent and would never show up on time. Also for the lack of communication with the seller. And the inconvenience from them. Not to mention it ruins the look for my kitchen. Also because Amazon would rather make up excuses for their sellers and still did nothing to help. So all they did was sent me the money back for my 1 item that like never even happened. I should have never decided to chose Amazon for anything! Ebay was way better for helping their buyers out."
Griselle189,,1,"Since a few weeks you can not ask for a single item with the option of free shipping, you have to spend $25 or more to qualify for free shipping, a bad trick!!!! since then I have not touched the button to buy in this app, as long as they do not send me free shipping they do not count on me as an amazon client"
AshmiNYC,,1,"Iím an avid Amazon shopper. The latest update broke the endless scroll. Reach the end of a list of items, stops, populates more items. The endless scroll is what makes the app nice. Hope they fix it."
PURPLE_HOODIE,,2,"The app itself works ok and it is an awesome way to get things but whenever I see something Iím looking for with great reviews, turns out to be fake review for things that isnít even what Iím looking at. For example, I was looking for earbuds but I see reviews for planes or plastic containers. This is a MAJOR flaw and can mislead people who trust amazon and donít take their time to be 100% sure of what theyíre buying online. I donít even know how itís possible to do this but it NEEDS TO BE FIXED!"
Ant Pete,,5,Did not expect to get everything as soon as I did. And I especially am HAPPY with the cheaper prices... really happy! I cannot tell enough people about it! Iím probably their best advertisement! Hahaha
CalsCorner,,3,"To say that Amazon as a service is excellent would be obvious. Everybody knows this, and Amazon has changed the world. But the iPhone app is unsurprisingly, a little wonky, or at least, not optimized well. 
People like Amazon and Google, who have products that compete with Apple, create software that is entirely their own, and not well-optimized for iPhone. Then they spend the next couple years dragging their feet. By no means do they have to do this. But you are eventually left with a pretty good app, which is what they have here. A pretty good app, now, I guess."

As I waited I got an email telling me the book was received and contacted them again about how long the refund will take, and they said to wait. As I waited, I contacted again just to make sure it was being processed and then I was told that I cannot get a refund and thereís nothing to do. I was upset because I wouldíve understood that a refund if that was what I was told the first time. Never ordering from here and telling all my friends about this."
tma17,,1,The app has crazy battery drain. 23 mins of on screen time shows 23% battery use. Thatís wayyyyyyy too much. Also the app is running in the background when background app refresh is disabled and itís closed out. Pretty sure this is a clear violation of apples rules and regulations regarding app behavior and data collection of information when opting out of background processes! Filing a formal complaint with apple today as Iíve made numerous complaints to amazon about this. Massive battery hog and clearly gathering some sort of info in the background when I havenít given permission for it to.
JGW75,,1,"i have a limited data plan. i just noticed this app has video ads that play automatically with no apparent way to disable. i dont want to use this app if it automatically plays videos

update: every time i add an item to a wishlist, a ìtrayî pops up in the bottom of the screen. every time this happens, i ìhideî the tray. every time I add another item, the tray comes back. why does amazon think I want this taking up space on my screen? I want to hide the tray permanently. If I wanted to see this thing every time, I would open it myself. I donít understand why app developers put these nagging features in their apps."

Yet when I looked up an otterbox case for my phone 50%-75% of the results were for an iPhone 6 plus. This is what lead to me accidentally purchasing the wrong size and non-returnable cellphone case in the first place! I just believe that they search results should be tweaked to better fit what is actually put into the search bar."
bellamc57,,2,"i ordered a package from amazon and the order said GUARANTEED delivery by saturday, but of course amazon has to change the date. I am not writing a review because they changed the date, I am writing a review because a brand shouldnít say itís a guaranteed delivery when they canít keep their word. I understand that delivery dates change all the time but this is different."
Uriel51,,3,I have really loved the Amazon app up until the last few months. It was the best way to find what I needed. Now when searching on items the selection does not even meet simple requests with lots of items not relating to my search to go through! & What is the WORST: I assume items without full descriptions meet my search request & order several things not meeting my original request!! Like searching on Google & needing to by pass the ads & first 2 pages to get to what really meets my needs!  To prove this I searched for items which did not appear on Amazonís results & later found them on Amazon after searching using another browser to look for Amazonís ad for the item!! Not consumer friendly at all. Amazon wants to sell us what they want to sell! PERIOD! Leaving Amazon if not addressed soon!

Amethyst Ameilia,,1,"Pretty disappointed that there was so much hype for amazon in Australia, literally everything I look at is quadruple the price the Americans get it for. Unless we live in ìmetro areasî shipping takes forever. I suggest maybe making things available to Australians and making the prices as competitive as you do for the Americans. Itís pretty annoying to be promised all of the same perks but only get 1/4 of the same perks if youíre lucky. Pick up your act or shut up shop in Australia. ??"

Charlotte E R,,5,I purchased a book on Amazon Australia earlier this week and purchased the priority delivery option to ensure delivery within 2 days. The book didnít come for 3 days and this was very inconvenient as I had gone on holiday by then. I contacted Amazon Australia about this issue and was so surprised with how quickly they got back to me and with how reasonable they were with finding a solution. I felt that they were really trying to make sure their customers have good experiences with them. I will definitely be using Amazon Australia again.

katym2007,,1,Better to access amazon through browser than using this app

Fitboy35,,1,"Log into the kindle store in Australia and fully 75% of the kindle books I wish to buy are ""not available for purchase from this device"".

Magnusbaron,,1,"How can such a big company have such a terrible buggy ios app?

Don't they read review or have a team to fix bugs? It's so poorly rated. Half the stuff doesn't work in the ios app"
Disgruntled Expat in Shanghai,,2,"The app has the most unwieldy and useless search function Iíve encountered in a long, long time. You canít correct itís auto-correct so, unlike just using the website, thereís no way to actually search for what you want. Most recently, it auto corrected an authorís name (Leslie) to ìLeolieî and could not be changed. 

Almost completely useless."
itouchya,,5,"Amazon just today back flipped and allowed overseas shopping and shipping again, which drastically increases the number of items available. The app works well. I look forward to Amazon shaking up Australiaís lazy, expensive anti competitive retail sector, including the supermarkets. You can get staple grocery items for quite a lot cheaper from amazon with prime than the big 2 supermarkets. I think itís going to be transformative over the medium term"
wadeface,,1,"Basic things like ìWatched dealsî give no notification when they are meant to. Amazons own advertising says it should for AU users. But it doesnít and their support confirm no notifications for AU users.

AU staff beyond disconnected and incompetent."

GinGirl,,1,Why arenít I able to purchase books anymore?
pja2536,,1,"I was prompted to install this app while making a Kindle book purchase via the browser on my iPhone. So I did!

Problem is that Kindle books display a notice that they can't be sold via this app!

Why then was I ever prompted to buy this useless app?

This is just typical of the lack of interest Amazon shows in its customers! Oh! I wish I could move my book collection somewhere else!

Mauricezxt,,1,"The app allows you to download a free sample of some books but not to buy them even though logged in, and the app shows the book is available on Kindle. No explanation is provided when you try to buy but the shopping cart just shows empty.

From the blogs I understand this is due to some mysterious reason apparently connected to which store your logged into. Trying to change stores doesnít work. If thereís some logical reason for this imbecility they should explain it, not just leave the customer flummoxed and angry. Fortunately alternatives to Amazon are appearing."

Yack27,,1,"I was really looking toward to using amazon, I had a ton of things added to my cart and my Wishlist but when I went to buy them I realised it was the American version so I could only purchase digital items from there.

philryan74,,2,Iíve gotta say that itís a bit useless. It canít ever find things whereas the website does. Error prone and useless so Iím leaving the App.
Mal_53,,2,"Ok, i get the fact that we need to pay GST on our purchases. No drama. But why do we have to still get a lot of products sent from the US? And then wait 2-3 weeks for the item to arrive?

Why? You are better off just buying from an online Australian retailer. You still pay the GST but you support an Aussie business and wait a lot less time for your item. Come on Amazon, you can do better than this. A half-arsed attempt at most."
That dude 78,,1,The search function is so badly broken that it doesnít even find things which are on the main site - save you iPhones storage space and use the website instead
Playyyyyyyy,,1,"It's terrible you can't order from overseas anymore. You are forced to use Amazon AUS only - if your lucky the item you want from Amazon US is available for delivery via the AUS Amazon. Used to love this app and was happy to shop from US, now it's just useless."
Marenojk,,1,If you live in Australia this App is absolutely useless to you seeing as Amazon no longer ship to Australia
Joelthemad,,1,Amazon seemed really good until I tried buying items in my cart and then told me I canít buy them because they donít ship the item to Australia. Whatís the point of having all these items on the store and barely any of it can get sent to my address. SO POOR!!! They donít even tell you if they canít deliver until youíve done your shopping so bad!!!!!!!! I just deleted amazon for good.

Boo!"
mysteriouslyme,,4,"I had no issues using this app. Amazon Australia on a whole has a lot of catching up to do if it washes to keep up with EBay; for example, Amazon has a lack of product compared to EBay and other online sites and some of the prices are (in some cases) nearly 3 times the prices compared to eBay or even in store. Having PayPal as a payment option will also help a great deal at the checkout."

MyNameIs-URL,,3,"We Aussies don't get the full benefits of Amazon Prime, we get free shipping which is fantastic but we don't have access to as many products as in the US. Two day shipping rather than 1, we get Prime video which is pretty good, access to about 1000 books, and Games (meh). However, no Prime Music, no photos storage or drive (which I think are included in the US prime package). Not a bad start but not as great as we were all hoping.

**********
From December last year:

The iPhone version of this app has Australia available as a country option. The iPad version doesn't. A bit of an oversight which makes the app both useless and pointless. 

I'd have expected better when the Australian store has been available for some weeks now."
SINFIELD6,,4,I just got this and itís so good! I also really like how you have a shopping list so you can add stuff to it
Ringo8661,,2,"Hey... I searched and got a selection that said ìAmazon Australiaî, so I downloaded the app, the first thing I wanted was Amazon Echo, and I find that it is not available for shipping to Australia. 
Two questions:
1. Why have an app that implies it is available for Australia when it lists Amazon products that arenít available to be shipped to Australia.
2. Echo is available in Australia, so why isnít it listed."
JJG765566,,1,"The new design is like navigating to the online version via a 2005 IE version browser!

purplepenny,,1,Why has the ëinternational shoppingí option disappeared from the country selection on the iPad? It was there for a few days and then it disappeared. It is an option on the iPhone version so I canít see why it shouldnít be an option on the iPad version. I shouldnít have to turn on the international shipping filter every time I search for a product. So annoying!!! Please bring it back!!

Shanneene83,,1,I am trying to shop by department and it wonít even let me do that.
directmattyg,,1,The fact that you cannot select Australia as a region in the iPad app like you can on the iPhone is beyond ridiculous. What are the amazon developers doing? Itís not that hard.

MissyGai,,1,"Amazon in Australia! Whoopee!

SamJDavis,,1,The iPhone app has it.

Mastazi,,2,As title says.
dilbert$2a,,1,The iPad version does not allow selection of the Australian store while the iPhone version does.  Being in Australia that makes the app useless for me.

Insomniac86,,1,Very poor form from Amazon. The iPad version does not allow you to access the Australian website. The iPhone version does however. This makes the app useless. Poor quality app from such a large company.
Message Guy,,1,"Amazon Australia have been active for months, and the iPhone app seems to work fine, but this app doesnít let me choose Australia as a country. This means my shipping times are either wrong or blown out because I canít narrow my search easily. Pain.

kittens24,,1,"I use this app almost every day. I browse and add things to my lists and regularly order online using the app.  I have been really happy with it until now.

The recent update however, has bugs.  With the latest update I find myself bashing the buttons which are now half the time unresponsive, like the top right icons (including search and cart). The see all lists link now only works sometimes as well. 

I have NEVER had this problem with any previous version. I am constantly force quitting the application in hopes of stopping this from happening, but so far there is no pattern to when it will work or not. Really frustrated!

Until this is fixed I can only give the app the minimum star rating."

Lang Dom,,2,Amazon theoretically exists in Australia launching earlier in the year. Still waiting for this app to offer Oz as country option. Seems like a critical piece of the launch has been missed
Scott123777,,3,There are a whole lot of features missing from the app that even the mobile version of the site offers. And theyíre features as basic as adding to wish/shopping lists and even viewing said lists
Khebab Hunter,,1,Was promised delivery within a week but this promptly blew out to 3 weeks or so after Iíd paid. Wonít be using Amazon in Australia again. Once bitten twice shy.
Mt Granz,,2,"In country selection under English, there is no Australia on the iPad version....I can see it on iPhone though."
Maxwell Bob,,1,"As at 22/12/17 there is no support for the Australian store, so pretty pointless here until that is fixed. The iPhone version works well."
Boltatsar,,1,No option to select Australia as an option???
DDCES,,1,Whatís the point of browsing the app if I canít even add items to a wish list. Deleted.
MickeyByrne,,1,This Australia launch has not gone well for Amazon. Australian store not an option after installing the iPad App weeks after launch.
ravenzino,,1,Isnít Amazon just made available to Australia? But why canít I find Australia in the list of Country&Language from my iPad while I can do so from my iPhone?
Aloishius,,1,"I do love this App, but without being able to choose Australia as my country, it is currently useless to me. Please update ASAP - I will then give it the 5 stars it will deserve."
Mb168,,1,When will Australia be added to this app? Even though Australian Amazon is up and running still no option in select country
Dovoson,,2,This app was very useful for me as i could purchase products from the US and get it delivered to Australia. With the launch of Amazon in Australia i simply changed the location in the app to Australia and now it will not open the app anymore. Completely broken. FIX IT!!!
Adam5754,,1,"It was with great promise that Amazon would arrive and show the local dinosaurs how to run an online shop. 
But it seems you just couldnít be bothered. Seriously anyone that has ever used Amazon in US or UK will simply not believe this is the same company. It is dreadful. Itís so bad I have to wonder if you were paid off by the locals to not ruin their honey pot. Poor service, geoblocking, import price hikes and substitute products from second rate manufacturers but under same brand. The thievery continues.

Letís hope that maybe, just maybe, this is just teething or testing phase. Cos otherwise it is plain embarrassing."
Aussie Razorgirl,,2,"Seriously?
Also, items that are available in the US Store are not available in the Aust store. Boooo! ??"
jpar2311,,2,The iPhone version has amazon Australia but the Australia option seems to be missing in the iPad version which is weird. Please fix this soon!
JTTag,,1,"Now that Amazon Australia has FINALLY launched, why can't you use this app to shop in the Amazon Australia site on the iPad??? It works for the Aussie store on the iPhone, but not the iPad - Please fix!! Please update this ASAP & then I will change my star rating to 5 stars, until then it's only usable for overseas Amazon sites."
00HAZ00,,1,When you first launch the app it asks to choose an Amazon region but it fails to include an option for Australia. This means the app is basically useless unless. Not happy jan ??
Lana Hack,,3,Whereís the Wishlist option for amazing Australia?
plasticscalpel,,2,"I was so excited when Amazon launched locally in Australia but once I switched settings from ìInternationalî to ìAustraliaî, so many products vanished so that they cannot be purchased from within the app.

Annoyingly, Amazonís attention to detail for the app itself is also lacking. For example, the customer support wonít let you leave a question under the ìanything elseî or ìsomething elseî section. Amazon has also ignored the standard user interface gesture of swipe-from-left-edge to go back to a previous page which makes navigation frustrating when hunting for a product on a large screen device.

Amazon, these early months matter and your new Australian market will notice the little things as well as the big. Please donít annoy your loyal customers or alienate your new ones by ignoring your app."
Aman singh.,,1,Why donít you just show times which are only for Australia even if you find some then posting fee is such a rip off????
kibnedyo,,1,"Reason for low rating is the app has not been updated for Australian launch of Amazon.
This means shopping within the app is not quoted in AUD, nor are retailers listed as reliably able to send items to Australia.

Come on Amazon, it is not as if you surprised yourself with the opening. Your marketing and app developers and management deserve a big wedgie for missing this detail."
mr_m0nster,,1,"Amazon launched in Australia last week, yet there is no option for Australia on the app... Soft launch Amazon? I'd say dud launch."
Eddy69,,3,I would like to see PayPal as a payment option???
aeviar,,4,Havent had any problems apart from there being no Australian address access
2bobwatch,,1,Where is Australian amazon app
Atef Farah,,3,"I understand that Amazon just launched in Australia but the range of items you can get on the Australian website is very limited, compared to U.S. I just want Amazon to launch Alexa as soon as possible I have 2 Amazon echo dots that think theyíre in Seattle, U.S. please allow Australian users to put at least their city. Prices are also a bit high compared to some of the same items you can get from eBay."
Valdon 41,,5,When will Australia be online.
amy_rawr,,2,"Used to be great but now it wonít let me log in anymore, keeps saying thereís an issue and itís very frustrating because the app used to be very convenient. Especially as a prime member, itís annoying that I canít purchase straight from my phone."
CastleBonesKaz,,5,"Amazon has been amazing, 

Don't get why people saying all those negative comments with amazon & Australia because I've brought lots of items on amazon & has had no problem with it?? 

I'd rather use Amazon then any other buying sites like eBay, gumtree, wish & all That. 

Prices are cheaper then what sells in Australian stores (like i seen a DVD here that's been out for ages for around $60 but on amazon can get for like $20 even new release DVDs include tv seasons are cheaper. 

What I can't get sent to Australia I can get a close friend from the country where it is (like US) get for me &
I pay her & few times she got as gifts for me. 
I'd give amazon a ??% good rating."
Grey XC 39005,,2,"If I filter for items that are available for shipping to Australia, how about showing only items that are eligible for shipping to Australia? 
Getting tired of finding the item then getting to the purchase page andî not available for shipping to Australia ì ."
Chookerry,,5,.
rrhorizon,,1,"Amazon is useless!
There is nobody that'll send the stuff I want to Australia.
It won't even show you what places will send to Australia.
I'm sticking with Ebay to get the things I want."
Cagataygwhshsud,,4,A good variety of item
Saundo11,,1,"Absolutely pI55poor.
You've had over 10 years to have this app ready for Australia.
Well done Amazon - I'll stick with eBay thanks"
KLRG975,,1,Makes app available in countries other than the US yet no products ship to those countries.  Unfortunately I had to give one star but itís not worth even that.
Djardi,,1,As others have already said (useless in Australia) thankfully itís free to download. I can delete it as it is just using up memory on my iPad.
Sampitheboss,,5,The app is great. The low rating is from people who don't understand that Amazon is an American based web store.
CaptainEazy,,1,"When it clearly says 'ships to Australia' apparently it doesn't. When I put all my details in, it just keeps saying wrong postal code and I think I know my own postal code."
QAFail,,3,"With the release of 9.20.0 you can no longer view the app in landscape, only portrait, on an iPad making it all but useless for most iPad Pro owners using keyboard cases. Please correct what Incan only gather is a bug given versions prior the 9.20.0 allowed landscape and portrait viewing."
Mark gab,,1,"Iím an Amazon user for over 10 years. I use an iPad. Now I have to turn it sideways to use the app.
What a stupid mistake!!!"
tricutie,,1,Not sure why this App is available in the Australian App Store.  No Australian site available.
Agough1,,1,Great site but postage to Australia such a rip off makes it unusable for me. Postage costs as much or more than items combined. I send all the time and know these prices are inflated drastically. Until itís fair is not for me
Papillon ;),,2,"Hi, have you guys thought of adding PayPal as a payment option?"
Bishop Cairns,,2,Won't update
akhowell,,1,"When voiceover, the built in apple screen reader is enabled, the app removes the Alexa functionality. If you try to fool it by starting the app with voiceover disabled then reenavle it, you get a hobbled voice search rather than the Alexa experience. This despite the functionality working perfectly before amazon decided discrimination against blind people is acceptable. This is blatant abuse of the apis provided to detect if accessibility is enabled and Apple should pull your app until it is corrected. Your developers should hang their heads in shame that such a discriminatory decision was ever implemented. If you care about fairness, donít shop with Amazon."
007munter,,1,"I am trying to buy a book on audible but there is no way to do this on either the Audible or Amazon app. All I can do is add it to a wish list. I can't get help by phone as I'm not in the US, and for some reason the app tells me I don't have email connected to my account, which I do, to email my question. Help service completely inadequate. Ridiculous"
remisree,,1,I am in aaustralia . The settings for country to shop in does not have Australia in list so i am unable to use the app.
bharadwajanshul,,1,It is very frustrating to update the app everytime in a week or two  - frequent app updates !
Nobullshitt@hotmail,,1,"Hated it maybe amazon is like this
On web is the same can't work out how to get indonesia currency not good"
NQJess,,1,Ummm... then what's the point??
Pickletothemax,,2,This app does NOT ship to Australia! Very disappointing.
Shopper8314,,2,"Agree with other comments regarding the need to make it more appropriate for international browsing 
The shipping is really what stuns me - In some cases this is nearly the same cost as the item which is unfair  and to bad if you want multiple items with multiple shipping costs - I hope we get amazon locally as this would transform online shopping! And make amazon top pick for online shopping."
Helena1970,,1,"This upgrade on my system runs slow, isn't allowing items to be added to cart.  Can't edit items from lists.   The problems just go on......"
Sam Tha man bru,,5,I kinda felt like I didn't get what I paid for I was expecting a PS4
Otachiuhs,,1,I can't sign in in app but still can sign in using safari web browser. also I can't purchase what's up with this update.

Even when I select the Kindle Store department, I get thousands of results which are not eBooks!!
When I select the filter only ""Kindle Store"" is selected, but thousands of items which are not from the Kindle store are shown."
Pippamer,,2,"Why can we not select Australia as a store when it's on the website version. 

Besides that, since when does Kindle need to have a source country if it's a digital copy?"
Bigtummy,,5,Works well and I recommend this app to all amazon users.
Calnn,,1,"""This item does not ship to your address..."""
Ggamer200,,1,Doesn't ship to Australia and there is no PayPal option.
Mika Bazzem,,1,This app is frustrating and useless.  You can not buy in the app and have to go to the Amazon app where you buy it then it doesn't show up. I wouldn't bother with this app until they sort out in app purchases so you don't risk not being able to use your purchase due to poor synchronisation by Amazon. Very disappointing.
MiltonRebeiro,,5,Enjoy shopping
hero2b,,5,"God knows how much ive spent in 8+ years ive had an account with Amazon. Ive always known there is no Australian store (my acct is in USA store). I stick to Amazon for freight rather than 1 of the millions of independent stores selling via Amazon; compared to our national postage service, its cheap 

There has been some pretty strange periods during its life  -  Amazon do love to tinker with their little app... but I use no other.  Theyre reliable, exceptional cust service, inventive, mind boggling assortment of goods & theyre fair.

NB
For Aus customers: 
Select  - 
SEARCH

Gary McBride,,1,"The app does not allow you to change friends list items to purchased when you buy elsewhere. This may cost you, your friend or family due to duplicates.

Gonebarrafishin,,2,"Would be a great app if there was an Aussie version. Can't purchase anything through the app if you have Amazon au account. There is no option to set the app to your Australian account, therefore when trying to make a purchase, the app tells you to log into the Amazon au website."
Tony Meman,,1,There isn't a setting to only show products that ship to Australia - so using the app literally wastes time as you see a product you want but try and fail to find a seller who ships outside of the US.
Cougarmumma,,1,Like all Aussies - sick of receiving emails and they don't send product to Australia- looking at a product & they don't send to Australia - and the postage is sometimes as much as the item - Bought shoes- US70 - cost AU130. Amazon sent wrong shoes and cost me AU40 to return and a fee .Gave me an Amazon credit of AU90 - Not happy n a waste of my time .

Adi855,,1,"Why does Amazon not give Australia any recognition.

Moggy99,,1,"Hey Amazon - Australia - large country in the Southern Hemisphere - just keep travelling south west from Mexico ( a country Amazon is aware of); population 24 million, many of whom read and make purchases online - how about including it as an option in this app - even just as a marketing strategy - you don't have to acknowledge our existence per se!  Yours ever in hope,"
Wayne Allan,,1,It's frustrating using your products. You force Australians to have Australian based accounts but your Apps don't seem to support them. Is Australia really that hard to support or are we a second rate market that makes you no money so therefore you could be bothered.

Azza1070,,5,"The review below me has absolutely nothing to do with the Amazon app itself and should be removed, I also live in Australia but a single product that cannot ship to Australia has no relevance whatsoever to the app and is a supplier issue.

It's too bad you can't give reviews a rating of 1-5 otherwise I would leave that person a 1-star review for their review.

Looking forward to a future version that packs more power and less angst. I want to change back to Usa as my country but the app thinks I already have that country selected.

Shanshuprophecy,,3,"This is one of the more glitchy apps I have encountered from a major company. Logging in is laggy to the point where I quit and restarted several times and the cart experience is close to absurd in that 'save for later', 'proceed to checkout' and 'delete' don't work. My cart looks like it is updating ( again, slow and glitchy) but nothing actually happens. I can't delete, can't save for later and don't seem to be able to proceed to checkout either. 

To top it off, as another reviewer pointed out, there isn't an option to search only those sellers who shop to Australia. 

As a browsing/saving experience-great. As a buying experience? Hell no."
Accursed,,1,"Do NOT use this app! I tried to order three different books, but when I went through the checkout procedure the app changed my order to three copies of the same book!

Use this app and you're just asking to be ripped off!"

We exist you know????"
JenniferLD87,,1,"Poor review process, Apple. If you can't buy content from Australia, this app shouldn't be available in the Australian App Store."
Purple skin,,1,"Yeah, so if someone could please show me where the option to buy something is or even just to add it to the cart, that'd be great. Thanks. I'm deleting this app as it isn't worth the space on my phone."
club80,,5,Well done Amazon
MikeD1508,,1,I agree with other comments about problems with app from Australia. Why is there no country choice available for Australia? Continually get CS3 error message. App not usable.

Must deliver!!"
matthk777,,1,"So... all in all, a useless app by a lazy app dept. of a major worldwide retailer. NOT what I'd expect from Amazon! (I can't even buy books from within my iPhone or iPad apps. Stupidness in the extreme.)"
akaKarenB,,1,"It is always annoying to discover that, of course, the much touted ""FREE"" shipping only covers the USA, but I can't even find out the shipping amount until after I have put my credit card number in. Bad form Amazon!"

Vicdib,,1,Using the app you can't order e books to read on the devise the app is on!  Do Amazon managers not understand joined up thinking or are they just complacent.  Amazon is a great company but then so was Kodak.

So well done there however, the Apple version of the app will not allow purchases which is a shame because now I go to Amazon app check out the average price then go elsewhere to buy. I wonder how many others do the same???"
leb4life ? 8),,1,Please add Australia as a country !!!
Saskiadubois,,3,"Fundamentally it's a great App. Easy to search and move around but I have 2 Amazon apps that don't appear to link up with each other and don't link in with my account on the computer? So I can't track an item that I'm desperately waiting for via the app.
Also would love to pay via PayPal... So much safer than the credit card."
Freib001,,1,Take it off if the Australian App Store if it doesn't even support Australian users!!!!! Very unprofessional and mildly offensive...
Sueob2135,,2,Please can you add Australia to the choice of countries
Robbie-yesss,,1,I downloaded the app but couldn't actually download any books. Just download Apple iBookstore in stead if you're in Australia (and have an apple product). It works a lot better too.
Sjsreading,,1,Are you serious?
Johnsluk,,1,Why be available to Australians to download when we cant even use it?!?! Waste of time. Back to the web ver and pot luck as to if I can buy something and get it delivered....

David E 2,,5,"This app is great, it does pretty much everything i can do on my computer but on my phone, people are giving this app bad reviews because they don't understand that this is an american company and there is NO AUSTRALIAN website for this company as such.

Timmy2skulls,,4,"No issue buying from Australia, not sure what others are doing wrong."

Annoying as it looks pretty cool."
leena182,,1,"So I thought this app would be awesome but there's no Australia in the country selection and it's not in the shipping selection either, incredibly disappointed :( waste of my time tbh"
Juperoo,,1,Why can't Australian residents buy using this app? Having a 'comprehensive' search feature is useless if you can't buy it when you find  it!
Unsatisfactory and annoyed,,1,I live in Australia and I can't download the books. I might as well just go online and get the book without even using this app. Please fix it.
Kol-2135,,1,Could not buy books for kindle reading. Last version was much better. Useless apps.
Helsbels80,,3,"It seems silly that the app doesn't offer an option to sort searches by price when almost every other buying website does. And then postage is never displayed either, so you could think you're buying the cheaper item then BAM, $20 for postage and you only found out AFTER you 'committed' to buy. 

That means I'll have to contact each seller first to see what shipping costs are, wait for their reply and THEN go back and calculate who the cheapest is. When 20 sellers offer the same product at different prices and their ratings are relatively the same, the cheapest cost gets my business every time. But for the legwork I have to do, I'm going to go elsewhere where it's done for me!

How has this gone unnoticed/unfixed?"
Tokkie11,,1,"Installed this app to purchase e books for kindle as the selection appeared good. Oops, waste of time as can't purchase the e books through the app. Am now going to spend the next 10 seconds deleting the app.  Don't bother with it."

Tess77au,,1,Still can't select Australia to make purchase and can't purchase Kindle ebooks. I should have read the reviews before downloading so I didn't waste my time. Please fix for all us Aussies!
Na-ba,,2,When are we going to buy a purchase from here and download straight to iPad? To me this is the most important upgrade that is needed. I live in Australia so not sure if it is just the case here but please fix this. Basically I have to go onto the website if I want it as an iBook. So it is a useless app other than to search.
mnjorgensen,,1,"I liked the UI, and the way comments etc were presented. When I compare search results on the website however, to the app results, they are quite different. Also reduced range in results using the app in some searches. Most frustrating (for me), Kindle titles under the Kindle 'Department' ... that aren't Kindle books, aren't available as Kindle books, that you CAN'T buy. But there they are in the search results?!

Wait for an update IMHO"
Strongarm11,,1,Where is the ability to purchase from the UK???  Waste of time unless you live in the US....

Tiuca,,1,Stuck on my iPhone screen doing nothing can't even delete it to get rid of it. Seriously don't bother with this. Taking space on my phone in limbo. Doesn't deserve rating.
the Impudent,,1,"The single reason I downloaded this app was to be able to purchase kindle books for my ipad2. But no, kindle is not supported says you need to purchase via the browser.

Just weird. Like all my details are set up to make single click purchase, this app is just weird. Please someone tell me I have it set up wrong."

Sodapop93gjjjhj,,4,"Pro- user friendly app, good prices, reliable shipping service, efficiently updated tracking info, secure. 
Cons- as an Australian user not all items are available to me, has to come from U.S so I'm left waiting for my goods to arrive but it is rather quick compared to other overseas based online retailers so it's not too bad."
Dcibhjherhj,,1,Downloaded and deleted within 10 seconds. Australia isn't one of the countries you can select!!
Ben MacLean,,2,"It's frustrating to browse for an hour for that perfect item, attempt to buy it, then to find that they won't ship to Australia (please let us be able to set a shipping country as a basic search criteria). And then when I find something that does ship to me, the app encounters an error (which has happened before using this app) so that I have to end up just going onto safari anyway. Until the app is better, just use the mobile site."
Kezzy88,,3,"cons

Kindle books can not be installed through app.

You can't pre set international shipping, you have to choose a department then choose international shipping every time you search something

Can only see top 100 products, you can not see any more then that unless you choose a department (each department only shows top 100)

Pros 

You can save items to wish list For future purchases

You can turn one click purchase on or off"
Mints13,,1,"I'm also from Australia and would appreciate the app being fixed for us. Using an iPad, which your website stated it was ok for, yet am unable to download ebooks. It is only possible to add to wish list and then you have to log in to website. Why bother having the app then. Definitely needs more work done on it before I bother using it again!"
TeachLeanne,,1,My ìbuy with 1 clickî button has become a ìdownload sampleî button instead. The app gives me no option to actually buy any kindle books. I have to use my browser. Iíve tried to find someone to contact but you donít seem to offer any direct support.
Kiwi6022,,2,It is very annoying that the App will not handle Kindle. Why not?

babycake1,,3,"So overall itís ok, what I find annoying & what wastes my time is that despite saying the shipping destination it loads items for sale that donít ship to my country. It would be great if there was an option to display only those companies that ship internationally. Another thing that wastes time is items displayed as eligible for shipping when you look into the product further & it has different size options, so go ahead clicking on those & choosing the size wanted, states how many is in stock then selecting the wanted size, it says sorry not available?!?"
jap008,,1,i paid from my international account and havenít got any refund or the product
Joshua Archibald,,2,For those who live outside the US this app is very annoying. When you change to your country and currency the app changes it back to the US everytime you quit out of the app and the settings are a pain to get to.

Teet17,,1,"This app doesnít let you purchase an ebook. Instead once youíve found a book, you need to add it to your basket, login online and then complete the purchase there.

Benjip,,2,"Overall a very frustrating experience and I will need to delete the app so it doesnít load automatically instead of the Amazon website when I click Amazon links.

Touch ID always results in an ìunknown errorî so I have to type my password manually. 

Searching/browsing does not tell you about products not shipping to your country until youíre well through the checkout process, so itís a waste of time searching for products and adding them to your cart only to find you canít even purchase them."

EuanG,,3,"This app works only if you never buy anything unavailable within the app, and there are loads of products you can't buy in the app. The annoying thing is that if the app is installed on your i-device then you are directed to the app when you go to Amazon in your browser, and so those items cannot be bought without deleting the app."

But... Recommendations are annoying. I don't live in the US, and its recommendations are a tease, because though interesting most of them won't ship to me.

Pr1nc3ss13-,,1,I havenít tried the app but Amazon in general Iím really starting to dislike. My issue is mainly towards the drivers. I pay extra every month for the Amazon Prime so I am able to get over night or two day shipping. I have had 3 times now an order show up delivered on my tracking and the item not show up. Twice the tracking showed up delivered in two different cities no where near my shipping address and the third is showing up delivered at my house which I have been waiting for the package and know that no one has walked up and delivered the package. I can understand a mix up once in a while but this is the third time since the middle of December so not even 2 months. Apparently the drivers sometimes mark the items delivered before their shift is over and was assured I should get my package still but why drivers are marking packages delivered when they havenít been is just stupid. I rely on the tracking to make sure Iím home since Amazon isnít obligated to knock on your door and give it to you. They are able to just leave it on your step and leave so anybody can steal your package when you arenít home.

Ebinheina,,1,The day I downloaded this app (without signing up for an amazon account) I started receiving spam emails from fake amazon companies. That makes this app as good as spam. What a waste.

Al Marenco,,2,"Tapped on an amazon link on Google from the US store, it opened on the app, asked me to change regions, did, once done I tried to change it back (to Canada) in region language in settings. It just wouldnít. It stays stuck in an endless loop of showing me the list of countries the app is available in English, always showing ëUSí selected and no way of going back other than hitting ëcancelí - you guys are ëAMAZONí, your software shouldnít behave like some second rate crap."

How is this helpful?  It makes me not want to use it when that happens. I love the app for ordering, its quick and easy to check out but searching needs a lot of improvement."
Acercon6,,3,"This app feels like it belongs in 2009. 

Get the job done, but feels unprofessional - almost like they havenít tried to freshen it up at all. 

Hard to navigate. LOTS of buttons and selections which could be narrowed down to a much simpler interface for users to find. 

Itís not what I expect from such a large company, especially one that people use daily."
Njdl75,,4,"I really wish when I ask for an item to deliver early or skip a month that it would adjust/update all future orders to the frequency Iíve asked instead of adding two items in one month. The only way Iíve found to ìfixî this so Iím not getting duplicate orders in one month is to cancel the subscription then going through the process to re-add the item to my auto ship. 

I also wish I could add items, including ìadd-onsî to my monthly delivery instead of having to have multiple shipments... this would be saving Amazon shipping costs if they add this feature."

Dopepotato,,1,"Everything in my cart, wishlist, save for later, became empty. Not only once or twice but multiple times. I don't have that good memory that's why I relied much on the save for later, cart, wishlist etc. I searched for what comes up in my mind and place in to my cart. When the first time everything in my cart gone, I started to add those things I want in to the save for later. When the second time everything gone, I started to put things in to my wishlist, but nothing helps. Thank you amazon :)"
LuckyLionLucas,,5,I wanna say itís great for everyone but Iím not sure because Iím prime member and books (the only thing I buy) comes to my house within 1-5 days. But I know for sure you can buy things with just a few taps. Overall really awesome. Really fast delivery.

Mandy1470,,3,"Being a member for the past year, I haven't had much luck as a prime member; having amazon lose my package in the mail more than once, receiving no email updates about it,  and having to call to ask to re-fund my account. Even as a prime member and choosing 1-2 day shipping, packages are usually delivered a week after the purchase date. A useful app, but some rough experiences. However, customer service (4 out of 5 times) is helpful and understanding."
Stellar fellar,,5,If I shop on a different PC or platform my shopping basket is automatically updated in the app. Item listings and searches done on a PC are the same on the app. No issues with shipping or payments. This app is solid.

And the gift has not even got delivered on time and itís showing that it has been returned however when i try to call with the customer service they say it will get delivered when next year??. It is also showing that the producht was damaged like seriously i paid almost double the price for custom clearance for what nothing to get delivered shame on you the service of amazon is getting worst seriously disappointed and even I havenít received a refund"
stovekat,,3,"The new update reminds me of some shady, cheap stores that rip you off like Zaful. Itís laid out now the same way and has a lot of complicated settings. Even me, being highly advanced in technology, can see that many people are likely to not enjoy this update and be confused by it. Please revert it back to the way it was, or a similar way."

Ffsfhjvfjbg,,1,"Pricing algorithms surreptitiously alter prices so that if you save on one thing youíll pay double or more for another. Watch the pricing on a few products youíve purchased in the past over the course of a month or so and youíll see exactly what Iím talking about. 

On top of that, the app makes it far too easy to shop. After using and watching the ìsubscribe and saveî featureís behaviour over the past couple months it is crystal clear it is nothing but a shifty money grab.

This app is a dangerous marketing tool to the consumer. Thanks Amazon, but I've had my fill. Back to the brick and mortar stores."
Whatever!!!?????,,1,What is the reason for rating it 17+ all at once?

Daytonpotter,,1,The app does not recognize that Iím a subscriber to prime. I have to use the browser version to utilize prime.
Linsei74,,1,"Amazon must not want customers very much...at least not according to the way they've treated me!
I placed an order with them which I never received and finally got a refund for after fighting with them for 4 months.
Usually I would stay clear after that but gave them another chance, thinking it was just a one time fluke.
So, I signed up for a 30 day free trial of Amazon Prime and placed an order for Christmas delivery. Guess what? My order was canceled and so was my Prime Membership! Even so, they tried to charge me for my free trial on my credit card 11x only 10 days into my free month.
I was reassured by a supervisor at Amazon, after talking to 3 different representatives, that my account would be reinstated within 24 hours and any charges would be reversed. 
Guess what happened?!?
48 hours later I my membership is still under suspension, I have a Prime Video membership they're trying to charge me for (even though it's cancelled in iTunes as of 4 days ago), and the Christmas present I tried to order still can't be ordered because I still have no valid Prime membership!!!
I can't get a straight answer when I call and they assure me that everything is ""fine"" on their end.
Does it sound fine to anyone else??? Or am I just overreacting??? The day I deal with Amazon again...
You get the picture ??????"

I have it set to ship to my address and all the items say that they ship to Canada but as soon as I press them it says itís unable to ship to my city (which is about an hour north of Toronto so it shouldnít be difficult) 

I signed up for prime about 6 months ago for the year subscription and it says I know longer have prime. I recently signed up for the free month trial and even still itís saying that this item is prime eligible but itís still $10 shipping..."

ciretas,,1,I think it is just unacceptable that a company like amazon would put out a broken update. I used my amazon app without issues for a while now and I regret ever hitting that update button. The app wont even open now even after restarting my phone and reinstalling amazon. I never write reviews but I couldnít help myself this time. Theres a first time for everything i guess right amazon?
CowieTheMage,,1,"Every time I press on an item, it gives me CS11 error, then leads me back to the main page, but it works fine with my iPhone, just not on my iPad..."
Floss_Daily,,5,"Always a wonderful shopping experience. Aisles are always clean, never crowded and I have yet to find a shopping cart with a faulty wheel. Do opt for the self checkout since the cashiers lack personality. Wish valet parking were available."
Anonymous-_-8,,1,I reinstalled the app back onto my phone. It barely opens before the app shuts off. Iíve tried restarting my phone and downloading the app again but nothing is working. Iím not sure whatís going on.
CityStormuri,,1,????. Please fix it to get 5 Star Rating

#MSN the best,,1,Is amazon broken???
leightont,,3,Recently a lot of issues with the product image not loading and the app ìstill loadingî a lot.? Bug? Glitch? Hopefully itís fixed soon.
bchow05,,1,Something is broken. Most of the pictures donít load on the app. It was working great until now. Was it an update or something else broken?
Manymanypeople,,1,Cannot be opened after upgrading.
djidoendndjeknsfolwlsjcjr,,1,Order two stuffs recently and paid extra for the one day shipping but guess what? Got 3-4 days delay.. come on amazon...
RileyBroChill,,1,Recently updated and now it wonít open just keeps crashing immediately! Needs a fix.
andre88223,,1,"iPhone 7plus, it closes once the app is opened."
The3rds,,1,"Check prices frequently.  Convenience comes a cost and sometimes that means paying much higher than what it should be.  I would prefer that the app shows price history so that you can make a more informed purchase.  Also, amazon does not match pricing for any period of time.  Unlike at a retail store, there is no price protection and so If you buy something at $100 and it drops to $50 the next day, you cannot contact Amazon and get the lower price.  You must return it and re-order.  Price history would at least show that it has gone on sale and what frequency.  Obviously, Amazon does not want to show that."
Hdgeheidhrudh,,2,When are you guys fixing you gift card shenanigans because I am tired of loosing money
Ceedini,,2,The last update as other users have noted has seemed to mess up the resolution. I have an iPhone 6s and I have no option to print after opening the label. The label opens fine but there is no print button. Please fix asap.
davvy05,,5,"Dear Amazon, thank you for making our lives easy. The fastest!"
Athena G,,2,Every time this app gets updated it gets worse and worse. Lost my entire wish list!
Colinha667,,2,No AirPrint support when printing return labels. There is no option in the app to print the return page and slip.
Barb2012,,1,Still no pass code for app
bursjon,,2,This app is good for the most part but it seems there has been some quality control issues. On multiple occasions the app does not display images correctly and is cut off on the side of the screen with no ability to scroll. Seems to be an aspect ratio issue to me. Let me know if you would like a screenshot.
Admirral,,1,"I cant use the app to order anything because I cant select my province. Whenever clicking any drop-down menu on the app, the selections dont appear. Had to uninstall and use the safari which was annoying since it kept pestering me to install the app... fix your crap amazon, your app should be flawless with the amount of money you have to spend."
Yhunhytg,,2,Cant add/ edit delivery address. Latest update has glitches. Fix it please
Pebbles83,,3,If you go from Canada store to USA store. Attempt checkout. But decide otherwise the whole store functions in white screens. You canít even toggle back to Canada. Or even log out and log in. You can only see the tabs options. But each tab loads blank white. Only way to get around this is to delete the app and install again. ??. Not very shopper friendly.
Besandaled,,2,"Iím a blind iPhone user and I used to give the Amazon app as an example of an app thatís well-designed for us. Recent updates are making it much harder to navigate with speech though, and my message about it to Amazon got a response that made no sense. Iím hoping that writing a review will get the attention of someone who understands the problem, but Iím not hopeful."
cass-a-roll,,4,"The Amazon app is so wonderful to use and shop with. Iíve purchased a number of items within the last few months. The app is fairly user friendly & everything Iíve ordered has come in a timely fashion. The only downside to this Is that I donít understand some of the perks like Prime membership & the daily deals & add on items- not to quite sure how these work yet, but Iím sure Iíll figure it out. Also, some of my items purchased take quite a while to come but over than that-wouldnít want to live without amazon in my life :)"
Hipnosis1,,1,"Wonít allow me to log in, crashes all the time. Switching accounts is impossible. Deleted."

There is no button that says ìreprint return labelî there is only a button that says ìemail to a friendî. 

Please Fix!"
Gena Mak,,2,"This app has few issues that make it unusable. Here are some of the scenarios I came up.  To fix them, really, should not be a big deal and for some, there must be some admin settings to enable. 

1. Scrolling through deals list and somewhere in the middle it refreshes and takes you to the top of the list after you just spent 5 minutes scrolling through products. 

2. Same as above, scrolling through the deals list and somewhere in the middle decided to check one of the products. Click on the product, checked it. Click back... again takes to the TOP of the deals list again. 

3. The upcoming deals list on Canadian amazon doesnít have WATCH button?! Why?

4. On the Deals page No option to sort items from newest to oldest. What if I already checked the list and I want to see newly added items?

5. The Deals list defaults to Relevant sort algorithm. Why? What is the Relevant?

6. Search for a product then, get the list of results, again you get 400 items with Relevant sorting. Try to select Lowest price sort. For some reason you get different list with 130 items results."
BATM/\N,,1,UI is very buggy in this release

Animapps reviewer,,2,App will no longer load. Crashes on splash screen every time. .. patiently waiting fix.
Wwrc,,1,"Seriously, sometimes I wonder how Amazon keeps going... I have never had so many issues with a big company before (and Iíve been around for a while)?? I canít sign into my app and then your nice enough to ask ìneed some helpî? So I click on that and it takes me to the page I was just on. So... do I have to attempt to open yet another account with you in order to place my order? You are doing your clients a disservice! If I was one of your sellers, Iíd be fuming mad! But maybe they donít know how bad your iPhone app is. Can you answer me as to why EVERY time I go to use your online catalog, I cannot because it doesnít recognize my email address and because of this, I apparently canít even contact anyone to fix the issue. Nice. Wow. Just, wow."

LostLady??,,2,"Needs to be fixed, Christmas is coming up."
UV meter,,1,"I rarely, if ever, shop at the Amazon Canada website. It is like going to a thrift mart in the most expensive city in the world. Poor or questionable quality items for prices most people would never pay. Most of the time the items one is aware about, are not even available on the Canadian Amazon site. The rest of the time, the item is 50% more expensive, and often shipping is added as well.
One has to wonder if this site actually makes money. Perhaps on people who are too lazy to click on another web page?
Unfortunately, I almost always feel like I am wasting time on the Canadian Amazon site."
iTunes User 89,,3,"When you login into Amazon.ca you could see both the ìPrint Label & Instructionsî button and the ìSend Label to a Friendî button. 

When using the app only the button that says ìSend Label to a Friendî is visible. 

You cannot print/reprint return labels from the app. It can only be printed from the web (via signing into amazon in Safari). 

Please Fix the App
Thanks"

Luci Furr,,3,"If you are a consumer that can actually afford to shop on this site without making out your parents credit cards , the first thing you should invest in is some good reading glasses because the text is so fn small and you canít see it unless you go into each and every stupid individual ad to read it. So with that in mind youíd have to quit your job because not being able to skim through youíll need all that time to view them all to really do a good shop n compare. Overall great site if youíre independently wealthy and have a lot of time on your hands."
Virage567,,1,"Worked great for a while then the ads and ad banners started screwing up my interface. Now everything I look up is wrong resolution and product information is stacked on top of itself like an old printer that had a paper jam but didnít stop printing.

Also all of the screen is crammed down the right side of my iPad now which makes the app practically unusable with the above problem.

Using latest IOS update and latest app build on an iPad Air.

You guys make enough money. Lose the freaking ad banners and autoplay movies and refocus your efforts on making a really good shopping app without the bloat and garbage.

For now I highly recommend avoiding the app and just use your computer."

I left one bad review and even returned the item, and now I canít leave any more reviews about the great products Iíve gotten, nor ask questions about items Iím interested in.

livingbubbly,,4,"I spend a lot of time using this product, and Iím happy I bought it from this seller. 

Pros: 
- I can make personalized lists for ANYTHING. Even the weird things. Including a list for all the extravagant and expensive stuff Iíll never have.

- If youíre like me and that makes you ugly cry, you can express ship tissues right to your door. 

Cons:
- I canít favourite sellers that I like.

- Itís hard to tell if something is ethically sourced in all the steps.

Tokiboy,,3,"The app is my primary go-to for placing and checking orders. Really easy to use and most of the bells and whistles of the full site. 

The area itís lacking in is when I have to search for something through amazonís ëcategoriesí rather than the search bar (if Iím browsing for items without anything specific in mind). Once the category is narrowed down, the displayed items are awkwardly placed in rows such as ëmost giftedí, ëbest sellerí, etc., but without any option to view the usual list method (for certain categories), which makes browsing kind of a chore. This is an oddly poor decision considering the usual ëfilterí and ësort byí options are available for certain categories (but not all) and searches using the search bar.

The list view for categories should be the default view, not the rows, or there should be the option to change the view. In the end, this is a somewhat minor complaint, but as it kind of impedes the ability to browse certain categories, I felt 3 stars was appropriate."

_____
Good news, Wish Lists working again in my version (not sure which version that is, exactly - sorry)!

One thing I would really like to see 'come to an end' is, 'Bottomless Pages' - i.e., pages that go on and on and on, with no indication of how many more items are left to view - don't know who started this concept, but I really do not appreciate it.

Current version looks like it may have mandatory Landscape Viewing (like BangGood app has implemented) - I do hope that will not be the case, going forward for the amazon app - it should be User's Choice, imo, whether to view pages in Landscape or Portrait."

I have deleted the app and reinstalled multiple times, signed in to a different account to see if it worked there and it didn't, I've completely reset my safari, nothing has worked. I am on iOS 10.3.3 running the latest version of Amazon, and the widget hasn't worked since one of the updates around new years."

Ittehbittehkittehcommitteh,,1,Last update made the app very slow and glitchy. I keep having to put in my password when I want to see my orders even when I'm already signed in. When I do put in my password I keep getting a 'something went wrong please try again' message every single time. Update needs fixing.
